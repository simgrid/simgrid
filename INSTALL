This page summarizes how to compile SimGrid. The full Install
documentation is available in doc/html/install.html or online at

              http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/

Getting the Dependencies
------------------------
SimGrid only uses very standard tools:
 - C compiler, C++ compiler, make and friends.
 - perl (but you may try to go without it)
 - cmake (version 2.8.8 or higher). You may want to use ccmake for a graphical interface over cmake.
 - boost:
   - Max OS X: with fink: fink install boost1.53.nopython, or with homebrew: brew install boost
   - Debian / Ubuntu: apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-context-dev
 - Java (if you want to build the Java bindings):
   - Mac OS X or Windows: Grab a full JDK
   - Debian / Ubuntu: apt-get install default-jdk

Build Configuration
-------------------
Note that compile-time options are very different from run-time options.

The default configuration should be fine for most usages, but if you
need to change something, there are several ways to do so. First, you
can use environment variables. For example, you can change the
compilers used by issuing these commands before launching cmake:

  export CC=gcc-4.7
  export CXX=g++-4.7

Note that other variables are available, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
to add options respectively for the C and C++ compilers.

Another way to do so is to use the -D argument of cmake as follows. Note that the ending dot is mandatory (see Out of Tree Compilation).

  cmake -DCC=clang -DCXX=clang++ .
  
Finally, you can use the ccmake graphical interface to change these settings.

  ccmake .

Existing compilation options
----------------------------

 CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (path)
   Where to install SimGrid (/opt/simgrid, /usr/local, or elsewhere).
 enable_compile_optimizations (ON/OFF)    
   Request the compiler to produce efficient code. You want to
   activate it, unless you plan to debug SimGrid itself. Indeed,
   efficient code may be appear mangled to debuggers.
 enable_compile_warnings (ON/OFF) 
   Request the compiler to issue error messages whenever the source
   code is not perfectly clean. If you are a SimGrid developer, you
   have to activate this option to enforce the code quality. As a
   regular user, this option will bring you nothing.
 enable_debug (ON/OFF)
   Disable this option toto discard all log messages of gravity debug
   or below at compile time. The resulting code is faster than if you
   discarding these messages at runtime. However, it obviously becomes
   impossible to get any debug info from SimGrid if something goes
   wrong.   
 enable_documentation (ON/OFF) 
   Generate the documentation pages.
 enable_java (ON/OFF) 
   To enjoy the java bindings of SimGrid.
 enable_jedule (ON/OFF) 
   To get SimDag producing execution traces that can then be
   visualized with the Jedule external tool. 
 enable_lua (ON/OFF) 
   To enjoy the lua bindings to the SimGrid internals.
 enable_lib_in_jar (ON/OFF) 
   Bundle the native java bindings in the jar file.
 enable_lto (ON/OFF) 
   Enable the Link Time Optimization of the C compiler. This feature
   really speeds up the produced code, but it is fragile with some
   versions of GCC. 
 enable_maintainer_mode (ON/OFF) 
   Only needed if you plan to modify very specific parts of SimGrid
   (e.g., the XML parsers and other related elements). Moreover, this 
   adds an extra dependency on flex and flexml.   
 enable_mallocators (ON/OFF) 
   Disabled this when tracking memory issues within SimGrid, or our
   internal memory caching mechanism will fool the debuggers.
 enable_model-checking (ON/OFF) 
   This execution gear is very usable now, but enabling this option at
   compile time will hinder simulation speed even when the
   model-checker is not activated at run time. 
 enable_ns3 (ON/OFF) 
   Allow to use ns-3 as a SimGrid network model.
 enable_smpi (ON/OFF) 
   Allow to run MPI code on top of SimGrid.
 enable_smpi_ISP_testsuite (ON/OFF) 
   Add many extra tests for the model-checker module.
 enable_smpi_MPICH3_testsuite (ON/OFF) 
   Add many extra tests for the MPI module.
   
Reset the build configuration
-----------------------------

To empty the cmake cache (either when you add a new library or when
things go seriously wrong), simply delete your CMakeCache.txt. You may
also want to directly edit this file in some circumstances.

Out of Tree Compilation
-----------------------

By default, the files produced during the compilation are placed in
the source directory. It is however often better to put them all in a
separate directory: cleaning the tree becomes as easy as removing this
directory, and you can have several such directories to test several
parameter sets or architectures. For that, go to the directory where
the files should be produced, and invoke cmake (or ccmake) with the
full path to the SimGrid source as last argument.

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake [options] ..
  make

Mac OS X Builds
---------------
SimGrid compiles like a charm with clang (version 3.0 or higher) on Mac OS X:

  cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++ .
  make
  
With the XCode version of clang 4.1, you may get the following error message: 
CMake Error: Parse error in cache file build_dir/CMakeCache.txt. Offending entry: /SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk

In that case, edit the CMakeCache.txt file directly, so that the
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT is similar to the following. Don't worry about the
warning that the "-pthread" argument is not used, if it appears.
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT:PATH=/Applications/XCode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer

In the El Capitan version of Max OS X, Apple decided that users don't
need no /usr/include directory anymore. If you are hit by this pure
madness, just run the following command to restore that classical UNIX
directory: xcode-select -install

Windows Builds
--------------

Building SimGrid on Windows may be something of an adventure: We only
manage to do so ourselves with MinGW-64, ActiveState Perl and msys
git). Have a look at out configuration scripts in appveyor.yml, but
don't expect too much from us: we are really not fluent with Windows.
Actually your help is welcome. 

The drawback of MinGW-64 is that the produced DLL are not compatible
with MS Visual C. clang-cl sounds promising to fix this. If you get
something working, please tell us.

Build the Java bindings
-----------------------

Once you have the full JDK installed (on Debian/Ubuntu, grab the
package default-jdk for that), things should be as simple as:

    cmake -Denable_java=ON .    
    make 
    
After the compilation, the file simgrid.jar is produced in the root
directory. If you only want to build the jarfile and its dependencies,
type make simgrid-java_jar. It will save you the time of building
every C examples and other things that you don't need for Java.

Sometimes, the build system fails to find the JNI headers:
 Error: jni could not be found. 

In this case, you need to first locate them as follows:
    $ locate jni.h    
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/include/jni.h    
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include/jni.h

Then, set the JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable to the right
path, and relaunch cmake. If you have several version of jni installed
(as above), use the right one (check the java version you use with
javac -version).

    export JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include/   
    cmake -Denable_java=ON .    
    make
    
Note that the filename jni.h was removed from the path.

32 bits Builds on Multi-arch Linux
----------------------------------

On a multiarch x86_64 Linux, it should be possible to compile a 32 bit version of SimGrid with something like:
CFLAGS=-m32 \
CXXFLAGS=-m32 \
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/ \
cmake . \
-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=i386 \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/some/path/to/i686-linux-gnu-gfortran \
-DGFORTRAN_EXE=/some/path/to/i686-linux-gnu-gfortran \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=-m32
If needed, implement i686-linux-gnu-gfortran as a script:
#!/bin/sh
exec gfortran -m32 "$@"

Existing Compilation Targets
----------------------------
In most cases, compiling and installing SimGrid is enough:
  make
  make install # try "sudo make install" if you don't have the permission to write
  
In addition, several compilation targets are provided in SimGrid. If
your system is well configured, the full list of targets is available
for completion when using the Tab key. Note that some of the existing
targets are not really for public consumption so don't worry if some
stuff doesn't work for you.

make simgrid                    Build only the SimGrid library and not any example
make app-masterworker           Build only this example (works for any example)
make clean                      Clean the results of a previous compilation
make install                    Install the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
make uninstall                  Uninstall the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
make dist                       Build a distribution archive (tgz)
make distcheck                  Check the dist (make + make dist + tests on the distribution)
make documentation              Create SimGrid documentation

If you want to see what is really happening, try adding VERBOSE=1 to your compilation requests:

  make VERBOSE=1
  
Testing your build
------------------

Once everything is built, you may want to test the result. SimGrid
comes with an extensive set of regression tests (as described in the
insider manual). The tests are run with ctest, that comes with CMake.
We run them every commit and the results are on our Jenkins.

ctest                     # Launch all tests
ctest -R msg              # Launch only the tests which name match the string "msg"
ctest -j4                 # Launch all tests in parallel, at most 4 at the same time
ctest --verbose           # Display all details on what's going on
ctest --output-on-failure # Only get verbose for the tests that fail
ctest -R msg- -j5 --output-on-failure # You changed MSG and want to check that you didn't break anything, huh?
                                      # That's fine, I do so all the time myself.
