The "Simplicity does not preceed complexity, but follows it" release.
Most important changes:
 * surf and simix modules reworked for simplification.
   It lays the ground for future extensions and improvements of SimGrid
 * SMPI was further improved, although not ready for production use yet.

On the way, we gained a bit more than 5% on the classical master/slave
example. More to come on this in future releases.

This dot release is mainly a maintenance one. Most important changes:
 * We fixed a large amount of bugs all around

 * We sanitized the way configuration is handled internally.
   Try passing --cfg-help to binaries compiled against this version.

 * SMPI is in better shape: lot of bugs fixing & usability improvements
   It may be worth trying it (even if all bugs are not gone yet)

This version may have a bit more of memleaks than 3.3. This will be
fixed in a latter release.

At least, after 2 years of hard work, we managed to release the 3.3
version of the SimGrid framework. There is so many changes that the
changelog only lists the most important ones, leaving alone the small
improvements, bug fixing and new gadgets.

In short:
 * Java bindings
 * New simulation models, and improvement of the GTNetS wrapper

 * Large memory savings (mainly in parser)
 * Faster (twice faster is not uncommon, and from 20 hours to 2
           minutes on very large scenarios)
 * Much better scalability (tested up to 250,000 processes)

 * Complete regression testing framework so that you can trust the tool
 * Lot of neat new modules in the XBT toolbox

This version was thoroughly tested on linux 32bits and 64bits
(debian), as well as Mac OSX (leopard).

Unfortunately, our windows-guy left, and we cannot release the windows
version at the same time than the other archs. Any help would be
really welcomed here.

Some of the 96 included test suites are known to fail, but everything
should work anyway (don't panic):
 * The amok module does not work in real deployment ATM, but I don't
   see this as release critical since I'm not aware of anyone needing
   this right now
 * Some tests about the ability of GRAS to receive messages from
   exotic platforms fail because I've lost access to these platforms
   (such as AIX)
 * the example/gras/pmm sometimes fails (about 1/10 of cases). I'm
   quite puzzled, but I suspect a bug in the test, not in the lib.
 * the tesh auto-tests "fail" on Mac OSX. This is because "rm -rf" is
   sometimes too verbose (when the OS creates hidden files, I
   suspect), but tesh definitely work as the rest on this arch.

We hope to manage to do more timely releases in the future, even if
that may turn out difficult since big stuff is coming (I don't say
much here for the suspense ;)

We hope you'll enjoy this new version, and please report any feedback
on the <simgrid-user@lists.gforge.inria.fr> list.
