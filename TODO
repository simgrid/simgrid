### Ongoing stuff
###

Document the fact that gras processes display the backtrace on sigusr and sigint
Document host module

/* FIXME: better place? */
int vasprintf  (char **ptr, const char *fmt, va_list ap);
char *bprintf(const char*fmt, ...) _XBT_GNUC_PRINTF(1,2);

Module renamings:
 - rename SWAG to RING?
 - Rename cursor to iterator

gras_socket_close should be blocking until all the data sent have been
received by the other side (implemented with an ACK mechanism).

### Planned
###

*
* Infrastructure
****************

[autoconf]
  * Check the gcc version on powerpc. We disabled -floop-optimize on powerpc,
    but versions above 3.4.0 should be ok.
  * check whether we have better than jmp_buf to implement exceptions, and
    use it (may need to generate a public .h, as glib does)

*
* XBT
*****

[doc]
  * graphic showing:
    (errors, logs ; dynars, dicts, hooks, pools; config, rrdb)

[portability layer]
  * maybe a memory pool so that we can cleanly kill an actor

[errors/exception]
  * Better split casual errors from programing errors.
    The first ones should be repported to the user, the second should kill
    the program (or, yet better, only the msg handler)
  * Allows the use of an error handler depending on the current module (ie,
    the same philosophy as log4c using GSL's error functions)

[logs]
  * Hijack message from a given category to another for a while (to mask
    initializations, and more)
  * Allow each actor to have its own setting
  * a init/exit mecanism for logging appender
  * more logging appenders (take those from Ralf in l2)

[modules]
  * Add configuration and dependencies to our module definition
  * allow to load them at runtime
    check in erlang how they upgrade them without downtime

[other modules]
  * we may need a round-robin database module, and a statistical one
  * a hook module *may* help cleaning up some parts. Not sure yet.
  * Some of the datacontainer modules seem to overlap. Kill some of them?
    - replace fifo with dynars
    - replace set with SWAG

*
* GRAS
******

[doc]
  * implement the P2P protocols that macedon does. They constitute great
    examples, too

[transport]  
  * use poll(2) instead of select(2) when available. (first need to check
    the advantage of doing so ;)

    Another idea we spoke about was to simulate this feature with a bunch of
    threads blocked in a read(1) on each incomming socket. The latency is
    reduced by the cost of a syscall, but the more I think about it, the
    less I find the idea adapted to our context.

  * timeout the send/recv too (hard to do in RL)
  * Adaptative timeout
  * multiplex on incoming SOAP over HTTP (once datadesc can deal with it)

  * The module syntax/API is too complex. 
    - Everybody opens a server socket (or almost), and nobody open two of
      them. This should be done automatically without user intervention.
    - I'd like to offer the possibility to speak to someone, not to speak on
      a socket. Users shouldn't care about such technical details. 
    - the idea of host_cookie in NWS seem to match my needs, but we still
      need a proper name ;)
    - this would allow to exchange a "socket" between peer :)
    - the creation needs to identify the peer actor within the process

  * when a send failed because the socket was closed on the other side, 
    try to reopen it seamlessly. Needs exceptions or another way to
    differentiate between the several system_error.
  * cache accepted sockets and close the old ones after a while. 
    Depends on the previous item; difficult to achieve with firewalls

[datadesc]
  * Add a XML wire protocol alongside to the binary one (for SOAP/HTTP)
  * cbps:
    - Error handling
    - Regression tests
  * Inter-arch conversions
    - Port to ARM
    - Convert in the same buffer when size increase
    - Exchange (on net) structures in one shoot when possible.
    - Port to really exotic platforms (Cray is not IEEE ;)
  * datadesc_set_cste: give the value by default when receiving. 
    - It's not transfered anymore, which is good for functions pointer.
  * Parsing macro
    - Cleanup the code (bison?)
    - Factorize code in union/struct field adding
    - Handle typedefs (gras_datatype_copy can be usefull, but only if
      main type is already defined)
    - Handle unions with annotate
    - Handle enum
    - Handle long long and long double
    - Forbid "char", allow "signed char" and "unsigned char", or user code won't be 
      portable to ARM, at least.
    - Handle struct/union/enum embeeded within another container 
      (needs modifications in DataDesc, too)
 
    - Check short a, b;
    - Check short ***
    - Check struct { struct { int a } b; } 

  * gras_datadesc_import_nws?

[Messaging]
  * Other message types than oneway & RPC are possible:
     - forwarding request, group communication
  * Message priority
  * Message forwarding
  * Group communication
  * Message declarations in a tree manner (such as log channels)?
  
[GRASPE] (platform expender) 
  * Tool to visualize/deploy and manage in RL
  * pull method of source diffusion in graspe-slave

[Actors] (parallelism in GRAS)
  * An actor is a user process. 
    It has a highly sequential control flow from its birth until its death. 
    The timers won't stop the current execution to branch elsewhere, they
    will be delayed until the actor is ready to listen. Likewise, no signal
    delivery. The goal is to KISS for users.
  * You can fork a new actor, even on remote hosts. 
  * They are implemented as threads in RL, but this is still a distributed
    memory *model*. If you want to share data with another actor, send it
    using the message interface to explicit who's responsible of this data.
  * data exchange between actors placed within the same UNIX process is  
    *implemented* by memcopy, but that's an implementation detail.

[Other, more general issues]
  * watchdog in RL (ie, while (1) { fork; exec the child, wait in father })
  * Allow [homogeneous] dico to be sent
  * Make GRAS thread safe by mutexing what needs to be

*
* AMOK
******

[bandwidth]
  * add a version guessing the appropriate datasizes automatically
[other modules]
  * provide a way to retrieve the host load as in NWS
  * log control, management, dynamic token ring
  * a way using SSH to ask a remote host to open a socket back on me
