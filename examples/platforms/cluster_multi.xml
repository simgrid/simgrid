  <!-- this platform models 3 clusters, interconnected over the Internet
    -
    -  This example intends to be somewhat exhaustive, your platform should probably be simpler.
    - 
    -  In particular, the clusters are modeled in very different ways,
    -  but you should pick the way you prefer, and stick to it.
    -->

  <!-- Here comes the first cluster, the simplest one.
     
       Every nodes are connected through a private link to a router
       (ie a machine that cannot host computations).
  
       node-0.1core.org __[l0]__
                                \
       node-1.1core.org __[l1]__router___(outer world)
                ...             /
       node-7.1core.org __[l9]_/
 
       So the route from node-0 to node-1 is {l0.UP, l1.DOWN}
    -->
  <cluster id="simple" prefix="node-" radical="0-7" suffix=".1core.org" speed="1Gf" bw="125MBps" lat="50us">
    <prop id="watt_per_state" value="0.0:1.0" />
    <prop id="watt_off" value="0.0" />
  </cluster>


  <!-- This second cluster has a backbone link, connecting all private links:
       node-0.2cores.org __[l0]______+
                                     |
       node-1.2cores.org __[l1]__[backbone]__ router __ (outer world)
                ...                  |
       node-7.2cores.org __[l7]______+
    The route from node-0 to node-1 is: l0.UP ; backbone ; l1.DOWN
    
    The route from node-0 to the outer world begins with: l0.UP ; backbone
  -->    
  <cluster id="backboned" prefix="node-" radical="0-7" suffix=".2cores.org"
              speed="1Gf"       core="2" 
	      bw="125MBps"      lat="50us"
           bb_bw="2.25GBps"  bb_lat="500us">
    <prop id="watt_per_state" value="0.0:1.0:2.0" />
    <prop id="watt_off" value="0.0" />
  </cluster>
	   

  <!-- This cluster has a backbone link, but no links are splitduplex.
    -  It means that up and down communications compete as if they
    -  were using exactly the same resource. If you send and receive
    -  at the same time, then each get half of the bandwidth.
    - 
    -  Also, the hosts have 4 cores.
    -->
  <cluster id="halfduplex" prefix="node-" radical="0-7" suffix=".4cores.org" speed="1Gf" core="4"
              bw="125MBps"      lat="50us"     sharing_policy="SHARED"
	   bb_bw="2.25GBps"  bb_lat="500us" bb_sharing_policy="SHARED">
    <prop id="watt_per_state" value="0.0:1.0:4.0" />
    <prop id="watt_off" value="0.0" />
  </cluster>

  <!-- And now, we create the routes between the clusters, ie inter-zone routes -->
  
  <!-- We have only one outer link, representing the internet 
    -  Its sharing is FATPIPE, meaning that communications have no impact on each others.
    -  Any given comm can use the full provided bandwidth. 
    - 
    -  This models the big links constituting the backbone of the internet, 
    -  that users cannot saturate. 
    -  Users' bandwidth is mostly limited by their outgoing connexion,
    -  not by the network backbone.
