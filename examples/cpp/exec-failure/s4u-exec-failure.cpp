/* This examples shows how to survive to host failure exceptions that occur when an host is turned off.
 *
 * The actors do not get notified when the host on which they run is turned off: they are just terminated
 * in this case, and their ``on_exit()`` callback gets executed.
 *
 * For remote executions on failing hosts however, any blocking operation such as ``exec`` or ``wait`` will
 * raise an exception that you can catch and react to, as illustrated in this example.
