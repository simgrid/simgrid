/* Parallel activities are convenient abstractions of parallel computational kernels that span over several machines.
 * To create a new one, you have to provide several things:
 *   - a vector of hosts on which the activity will execute
 *   - a vector of values, the amount of computation for each of the hosts (in flops)
 *   - a matrix of values, the amount of communication between each pair of hosts (in bytes)
 *
 * Each of these operation will be processed at the same relative speed.
 * This means that at some point in time, all sub-executions and all sub-communications will be at 20% of completion.
 * Also, they will all complete at the exact same time.
 *
 * This is obviously a simplistic abstraction, but this is very handful in a large amount of situations.
 *
 * Please note that you must have the LV07 platform model enabled to use such constructs.
