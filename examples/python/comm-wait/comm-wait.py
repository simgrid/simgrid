"""
This example shows how to use simgrid::s4u::this_actor::wait() to wait for a given communication.

As for the other asynchronous examples, the sender initiate all the messages it wants to send and
pack the resulting simgrid::s4u::CommPtr objects in a vector. All messages thus occurs concurrently.

The sender then loops until there is no ongoing communication.
