"""
This example shows how to simulate a non-linear resource sharing for disk
operations.

It is inspired on the paper
"Adding Storage Simulation Capacities to the SimGridToolkit: Concepts, Models, and API"
Available at : https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01197128/document

It shows how to simulate concurrent operations degrading overall performance of IO
operations (specifically the effects presented in Fig. 8 of the paper).
