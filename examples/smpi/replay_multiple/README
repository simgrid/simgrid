This is an example of the replay of several traces in the same simulation, to watch how they interact on a platform.

The main item of this example is the description file

The description_file file is an example of the launching of 2 replay traces (both of the same application/size).

Each line has the form :

instance_id replay_file instance_size delay

example :

2 smpi_replay.txt 32 125000000000

This launchs an instance "2" that will replay file smpi_replay.txt with 32 processes, and each one of these processes 
will sleep for 125000000000 flops before the run.

In order to be replayed, a deployment file must be generatedfrom this description file, and from the intended platform 
file and hostfiles. The script generate_multiple_deployment.sh can be used as such : 

./generate_multiple_deployment.sh -platform platform_file.xml -hostfile hostfile  description_file deployment.xml

The output deployment file will be written in deployment.xml

Please not that the deployment will use the hostfile in order, placing processes of the first instance using the first 
node, and the ones of the following instances on the following nodes.

The actual replay can now be launched, using classic options for SMPI

./replay_multiple description_file platform_file.xml deployment.xml --cfg=... --log=...
