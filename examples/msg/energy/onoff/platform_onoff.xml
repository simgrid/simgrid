  <!-- Use the pstate mechanism to encode the boot/shutdown time and energy -->

  <!-- That may be seen as a misuse of the pstate mechanism and crude hack, but this is efficient: we can do what 
       we want without too much burden, and since the whole intelligence is at user level, we do control the model. 

       The same could be done to encode the time and energy to switch between pstates. These times seem negligible 
       in our experiments, but if they are important to you, now you know how to do that. -->

  <!-- pstate values:
    * 0-2: real pstates
       0: p1 100 MFlops/s, [idle: 95W -> full burning: 200W]
       1: p2  50 MFlops/s, [idle: 93W -> full burning: 170W]
       2: p3  20 MFlops/s, [idel: 90W -> full burning: 150W] 
    * 3: booting up was measured to take 150s and 18000J.
         So we create a pstate with 1 flop/150 s so that the application burns 1 flop in that virtual pstate to
         simulate a boot.
         Multiply everything by 1000 or whatever if this trick is too painful to you, that's the same by the end.
         The energy consumption is 18000/150=120W
    * 4: shuting down was measured to take 7 s and 770 J

    Please note that we tried to put sensible values in this file but you should still take them with a grain of salt.
    If you want a realistic simulation, you have to actually benchmark your platform and application, and use the 
    values that are right for you. -->
