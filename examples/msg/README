MSG comes with an extensive set of examples. It is sometimes difficult
to find the one you need. This list aims at helping you finding the
example from which you can learn what you want to.

Basic examples and features
===========================
 * sendrecv/sendrecv.c: Ping-pong example. It's hard to think of a
   simpler example. The tesh files laying in the directory are
   instructive concerning the way to pass options to the simulators
   (as described in "Simgrid options and configurations").

 * masterslave/masterslave_forwarder.c: Master/slaves example. This
   good old example is also very simple. Its basic version is fully
   commented in the web documentation, but several variants can be
   found in the same directory.

 * masterslave/masterslave_console.c: demonstrate how to use lua files
   instead of XML for the platform and deployment declaration using
   MSG_load_platform_script(). The most interesting part is probably
   not the C code, but rather the masterslave/masterslave_script.lua,
   which demonstrates how to express the platform and deployment in
   lua.

 * migration/migration.c Demonstrates how to use the
   MSG_process_migrate() function to let processes change the host
   they run on after their start.

 * suspend/suspend.c: Demonstrates how to suspend and resume processes
   using MSG_process_suspend() and MSG_process_resume().

 * properties/msg_prop.c Attaching arbitrary informations to host,
   processes and such, and retrieving them with
   MSG_host_get_properties(), MSG_host_get_property_value(),
   MSG_process_get_properties() and MSG_process_get_property_value().
   Also make sure to read the platform and deployment XML files to see
   how to declare these data.

 * parallel_task/parallel_task.c: Demonstrates the use of
   MSG_parallel_task_create(), to create special tasks that run on
   several hosts at the same time. The resulting simulations are very
   close to what can be achieved in SimDag, but still allows to use
   the other features of MSG (it'd be cool to be able to mix
   interfaces, but it's not possible ATM).

 * priority/priority.c: Demonstrates the use of
   MSG_task_set_priority() to change the computation priority of a
   given task.

Asynchronous communications
===========================
There is several examples of asynchronous communications coming in the
archive. In addition to the fully documented example [50]Asynchronous
communications, there is several other examples in the archive:
   
 * msg/icomms/peer.c: basic example of async functions
   (MSG_task_isend, MSG_task_irecv, MSG_comm_wait)
 * msg/icomms/peer2.c: demonstrates the MSG_comm_waitall() function
 * msg/icomms/peer3.c: demonstrates the MSG_comm_waitany() function

Tracing and visualization features
==================================
 * tracing/simple.c very simple program that creates, executes and
   destroy a task
 * tracing/ms.c TODO
 * tracing/categories.c example with the declaration of multiple
   categories
 * tracing/procmig.c example to trace process migration using the mask
   TRACE_PROCESS
 * tracing/trace_platform.c: Demonstrates how to trace the platform
 * tracing/user_variables.c: Demonstrates how to trace user-provided
   variables

Models-related examples
=======================

Packet level simulators
-----------------------
These examples demonstrate how to use the bindings to classical
Packet-Level Simulators (PLS), as explained in the relevant part of
the web documentation. The most interesting is probably not the C
files since they are unchanged from the other simulations, but the
associated files, such as the platform files to see how to declare a
platform to be used with the PLS bindings of SimGrid and the tesh
files to see how to actually start a simulation in these settings.
   
 * ns3: Simple ping-pong using ns3 instead of the SimGrid models
 * gtnets Simple ping-pong using GTNeTs instead of the SimGrid models

Other resource kinds
--------------------
This section contains some sparse examples of how to use the other
kind of resources, such as disk. These resources are quite
experimental for now, but here we go anyway. 

 * io/file.c Example with the disk resource

Trace driven simulations
========================

The actions/actions.c example demonstrates how to run trace-driven
simulations. It is very handy when you want to test an algorithm or
protocol that does nothing unless it receives some events from
outside. For example, a P2P protocol reacts to requests from the user,
but does nothing if there is no such event.

In such situations, SimGrid allows to write your protocol in your C
file, and the events to react to in a separate text file. Declare a
function handling each of the events that you want to accept in your
trace files, register them using MSG_action_register in your main, and
then use MSG_action_trace_run to launch the simulation. You can either
have one trace file containing all your events, or a file per
simulated process. Check the tesh files in the example directory for
details on how to do it.

This example uses this approach to replay MPI-like traces. It comes
with a set of event handlers reproducing MPI events. This is somehow
similar to SMPI, yet differently implemented. This code should
probably be changed to use SMPI internals instead, but wasn't, so far.

Examples of full applications
=============================

 * token_ring/ring_call.c: Classical token ring communication, where a
   token is exchanged along a ring to reach every participant.

 * pmm/msg_pmm.c: Parallel Matrix Multiplication is a little
   application. This is something that most MPI developper have
   written during their class, here implemented using MSG instead of
   MPI.

 * chord/chord.c: Classical Chord P2P protocol This example implements
   the well known Chord P2P protocol. Its main advantage is that it
   constitute a fully working non-trivial example. In addition, its
   implementation is rather efficient, as demonstrated in
   [57]http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00602216/
