There are two tests:
- The first one aims at validating the migration in presence of consolidated VMs
- The second one aims at validating the robustness of the migration process (the SRC node or the DST node are turned off during the migration process)

To switch between the first and the second tests, you should instrument Main.java (sorry for that :( )

UPDATE: the second test was never used (dit it ever work?), and was removed 4 years later
