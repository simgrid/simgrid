S4U (Simgrid for you) is the next interface of SimGrid, expected to be released with SimGrid 4.0.

Even if it's in a very preliminary state so far, you are welcome to try it and report any interface glitches that you 
see. Be however warned that the interface will be modified until its final release. 
You will have to adapt your code on the way.
