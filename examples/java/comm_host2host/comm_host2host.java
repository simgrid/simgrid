/* This simple example demonstrates the Comm.sento_init() Comm.sento_async() functions,
   that can be used to create a direct communication from one host to another without
   relying on the mailbox mechanism.

   There is not much to say, actually: The _init variant creates the communication and
   leaves it unstarted (in case you want to modify this communication before it starts),
   while the _async variant creates and start it. In both cases, you need to wait() it.

   It is mostly useful when you want to have a centralized simulation of your settings,
   with a central actor declaring all communications occurring on your distributed system.
