/* This example shows how to serialize a set of communications going through a link using Link::set_concurrency_limit()
 *
 * This example is very similar to the other asynchronous communication examples, but messages get serialized by the
 * platform. Without this call to Link::set_concurrency_limit(2) in main, all messages would be received at the exact
 * same timestamp since they are initiated at the same instant and are of the same size. But with this extra
 * configuration to the link, at most 2 messages can travel through the link at the same time.
