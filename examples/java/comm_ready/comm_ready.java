/* This example shows how to use Mailbox.ready() to check for completed communications.
 *
 * We have a number of peers which send and receive messages in two phases:
 * -> sending phase:   each one of them sends a number of messages to the others followed
 *                     by a single "finalize" message.
 * -> receiving phase: each one of them receives all the available messages that reached
 *                     their corresponding mailbox until it has all the needed "finalize"
 *                     messages to know that no more work needs to be done.
 *
 * To avoid doing an await() over the ongoing communications, each peer makes use of the
 * Mailbox.ready() method. If it returns true then a following get() will fetch the
 * message immediately, if not the peer will sleep for a fixed amount of time before checking again.
 *
