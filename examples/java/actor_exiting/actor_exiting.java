/* There is two very different ways of being informed when an actor exits.
 *
 * The this_actor::on_exit() function allows one to register a function to be
 * executed when this very actor exits. The registered function will run
 * when this actor terminates (either because its main function returns, or
 * because it's killed in any way). No simcall are allowed here: your actor
 * is dead already, so it cannot interact with its environment in any way
 * (network, executions, disks, etc).
 *
 * Usually, the functions registered in this_actor::on_exit() are in charge
 * of releasing any memory allocated by the actor during its execution.
 *
 * The other way of getting informed when an actor terminates is to connect a
 * function in the Actor::on_termination signal, that is shared between
 * all actors. Callbacks to this signal are executed for each terminating
 * actors, no matter what. This is useful in many cases, in particular
 * when developing SimGrid plugins.
 *
 * Finally, you can attach callbacks to the Actor::on_destruction signal.
 * It is also shared between all actors, and gets fired when the actors
 * are destroyed. A delay is possible between the termination of an actor
 * (ie, when it terminates executing its code) and its destruction (ie,
 * when it is not referenced anywhere in the simulation and can be collected).
 *
 * In both cases, you can stack more than one callback in the signal.
 * They will all be executed in the registration order.
