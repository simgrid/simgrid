/* This is an example of how the bootup and shutdown periods can be modeled
 * with SimGrid, taking both the time and overall consumption into account.
 *
 * The main idea is to augment the platform description to declare fake
 * pstate that represent these states. The CPU speed of these state is zero
 * (the CPU delivers 0 flop per second when booting) while the energy
 * consumption is the one measured on average on the modeled machine.
 *
 * When you want to bootup the machine, you set it into the pstate encoding
 * the boot (3 in this example), and leave it so for the right time using a
 * sleep_for(). During that time no other execution can progress since the
 * resource speed is set at 0 flop/s in this fake pstate. Once this is over,
 * the boot is done and we switch back to the regular pstate. Conversely,
 * the fake pstate 4 is used to encode the shutdown delay.
 *
 * Some people don't like the idea to add fake pstates for the boot time, and
 * would like SimGrid to provide a "cleaner" model for that. But the "right"
 * model depends on the study you want to conduct. If you want to study the
 * instantaneous consumption of a rebooting data center, the model used here
 * is not enough since it considers only the average consumption over the boot,
 * while the instantaneous consumption changes dramatically. Conversely, a
 * model taking the instantaneous changes into account will be very difficult
 * to instantiate correctly (which values will you use?), so it's not adapted
 * to most studies. At least, fake pstates allow you to do exactly what you
 * need for your very study.
