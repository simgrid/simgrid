/* This example demonstrate the actor migrations.
 *
 * The worker actor first move by itself, and then start an execution.
 * During that execution, the monitor migrates the worker, that wakes up on another host.
 * The execution was of the right amount of flops to take exactly 5 seconds on the first host
 * and 5 other seconds on the second one, so it stops after 10 seconds.
 *
 * Then another migration is done by the monitor while the worker is suspended.
 *
 * Note that worker() takes an uncommon set of parameters,
 * and that this is perfectly accepted by create().
