\section bindings_binding_java_install How to install Simgrid-java

To use java with Simgrid you have to install some dependencies:
 \li Simgrid (see <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/latest/doc/install.html">install
     Simgrid</a>). You should set the SIMGRID_ROOT environment
     variable to the path where you installed SimGrid.
 \li Java JDK packages, such as openjdk7 or sun-java6-jdk (with
     libgcj10-dev or another version of gcj). For maximal performance
     and scalability, use a coroutine-enabled JVM (see
     \ref bindings_binding_java_coroutines).
 
Then Download and install package Simgrid-java:
\verbatim
git clone git://scm.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid-java.git
cd simgrid-java
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/Install/simgrid-java/ .
make install
\endverbatim
 
Cmake output
\verbatim

\endverbatim

If cmake complains that jni could not be found, you need to tell it
where JNI header files are located. the following command should tell
you:

\verbatim
$ locate jni.h
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include/jni.h
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/include/jni.h
\endverbatim

If you have several version of jni installed (as in the example
above), you need to check the version of java that is used by default
on your machine (using javac -version), and pick the right one. Then
set the JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH environment variable to the right path (note
that we remove the filename jni.h from that path), and relaunch cmake.

\vebatim
export JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include/
\endverbatim

\section bindings_binding_java_use How to use Simgrid-java

To execute the examples you need to add the path where you installed
the generated libSG_java library (<build_dir>/lib) and libsimgrid
($SIMGRID_ROOT/lib) into the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Be careful on Mac, this variable is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and not
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

\verbatim
$ export SIMGRID_ROOT="$HOME/Install/simgrid/" # change it to the path where you installed the SimGrid library
$ export SIMGRID_JAVA_ROOT="$HOME/Install/simgrid-java" # change it to the path where you installed the java bindings of SimGrid 
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}$SIMGRID_ROOT/lib:$SIMGRID_JAVA_ROOT/java
$ cd examples
$ java -cp .:../simgrid.jar basic/BasicTest platform.xml basic/basicDeployment.xml
\endverbatim

If you want to make these settings permanent even after a reboot, you
need to add the export lines into your ~/.bashrc file, or equivalent.




\section bindings_binding_java_coroutines How to use the coroutines context factory

There is two main motivations to use the coroutine variant of SimGrid
Java bindings: it's about 5 times faster than the default thread-based
context factory, and the amount of runnable processes is then only
limited by the amount of RAM that you have. The drawbacks are that it
requires a specific and rather experimental JVM to run, and that this
context factory itself remains a bit experimental so far.

\subsection  bindings_java_coro_install Getting a mlvm JVM

You need to get a patched JVM from <a href="http://ssw.jku.at/General/Staff/LS/coro/">here</a>
(many thanks to Lukas Stadler for this work!). 

You can either get a prebuilt binary, or recompile your own JVM. Make
sure to get a coro-simple version, as we don't need to serialize nor
migrate stacks in SimGrid. You should be able to follow the README.txt
that you'll get in the repository, but here is how we did it, just in
case. The instructions are given for a debian or Ubuntu box, but I
think you should manage to convert it to your system quite easily.
Finally, if you're really stuck, you can get the version compiled by
Jonathan Rouzaud-Cornabas from his web page. This version is known to
work with SimGrid for sure!

 -# Install mercurial and some dependencies
\verbatim 
sudo apt-get install mercurial ksh libfreetype6-dev libcups2-dev libasound2-dev gawk openjdk-7-jdk libxext-dev libxrender-dev libxtst-dev
# Grab the forest extension: we need to source-install it
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/gxti/hgforest hgforest \endverbatim
\endverbatim
 -# Configure the mercurial extensions: Edit ~/.hgrc and paste the
    following lines. Don't forget to change the /path/to/forest.py to
    point to where you just downloaded the source. 
    
    Forest extension is needed to download the openjdk source code and
    patches while the mq line is needed to apply the patches. The
    username is needed at the step "preparing the sources", not sure why.
\verbatim
[ui]
username = YouUserameWithoutSpaces
[extensions]
forest=/path/to/forest.py
mq=
\endverbatim
 -# Prepare the source code
\verbatim 
# create a working directory, and enter it
mkdir davinci; cd davinci

# Grab the sources
hg fclone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/hsx/hotspot-comp sources
# Grab the patches
hg fclone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/mlvm/mlvm patches

# Link the patch directories into the sources
bash patches/make/link-patch-dirs.sh sources patches
# Test wether the previous command worked with
ls -i patches/hotspot/series sources/hotspot/.hg/patches/series
# It should display something like the following.
# (note that both file share the same inode number)
#  9707849 patches/hotspot/series  
#  9707849 sources/hotspot/.hg/patches/series


# Specify what to compile. 
export davinci=$(pwd) guards="buildable testable coro-simple"
# Apply the patches
sh patches/make/each-patch-repo.sh hg qselect --reapply $guards '$(sh $davinci/patches/make/current-release.sh)'
# Check that it understood that you want the patch applied:
grep GLOBAL_GUARDS patches/make/* -r
# this should display something like the following (maybe amonst other unrelated lines)
# GLOBAL_GUARDS=buildable testable coro-simple
# If this does not work, edit patches/make/Makefile,
#   manually coro-simple to GLOBAL_GUARDS and then 
#   rerun the patches/make/each-patch-repo.sh script as earlier


# Finish the setup
(cd patches/make; make setup && make force && make && make FORCE_VERSIONS=1 && echo "Sources are properly setup")
# If this last command failed, check your mercurial config within ~/.hgrc (see above)
\endverbatim	       
 -# Compile it all
\verbatim
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export ALT_BOOTDIR=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/
cd sources
# Check that everything is fine
make sanity
# Go for it (it takes about half an hour on my machine)
make all

# Check that the coroutine library got compiled in
ls sources/build/linux-amd64/classes/java/dyn/
# This should display a bunch of class files. If not, something went wrong, you need to investigate further
\endverbatim

\subsection  bindings_java_coro_use Using coroutine contexts

SimGrid Java will automatically switch to the coroutine context
factory if your JVM support it, so you will just need to execute your
simulation with the correct JVM. The selected context factory gets
displayed automatically.
\verbatim
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/simgrid.so:/path/to/libSG_java.so
cd examples
$PATH_TO_COROUTINE_JVM/java -cp .:../simgrid.jar masterslave.Masterslave masterslave/ masterslaveDeployment.xml platform.xml
\endverbatim

Note that you may have to adjust the "coro.stacksPerThread"
configuration option to run large simulations. The default is 100 and
you want to increase it to run more processes.
\verbatim
$ $PATH_TO_COROUTINE_JVM/java -Dcoro.stacksPerThread=$STACKS_NUMBER -cp .:../simgrid.jar basic/BasicTest platform.xml basic/basicDeployment.xml
\endverbatim

If you reach the point where the creation of new simulated processes
fail with the message "Can't create coroutine object", you may need to
increase the relevant system limit with the following command.
\verbatim 
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count = 131072
\endverbatim

The full story is that each coroutine requires two memory maps, and
that Linux puts a limit on the total amount of memory maps that each
process can manage (by default, this limit is often at 65535). Since
the JVM needs a few dozen of such maps on its own (three maps per
dynamic library -- check /proc/the_pid/maps if you don't believe it),
this is enough to create over 30,000 simulated processes. But to go
futher, that limit must be modified. 

If you want to make this change permanent on your machine, edit your
/etc/sysctl.conf file. Otherwise, you have to redo it by calling
sysctl after each reboot.
