@section simgrid_dev_guide_model How to add a new model?
The figure below shows the architecture of the SURF layer. This layer is composed
of different kinds of models representing the different systems we want to
model (i.e., cpu, network, storage, workstation, virtual machine).

A model in SimGrid is composed of three classes: Model, Resource and Action
(@ref SURF_interface "surf_interface.hpp").

@image latex surf++.pdf "surf++" width=\textwidth

Actually there are five kind of models: CpuModel, NetworkModel, WorkstationModel,
WorkstationVMModel and StorageModel. For each kind of model, there is an
interface (e.g.: @ref SURF_cpu_interface "CpuImpl.hpp") and some implementations (e.g.: cpu_cas01.hpp,
cpu_ti.hpp).

The CPU model Cas01, for instance, is initialized by the function
    void surf_cpu_model_init_Cas01()

The different network models that are offered by simgrid are stored in the array
that is defined as follows:

s_surf_model_description_t surf_network_model_description[] = {

@subsection simgrid_dev_guide_model_implem How to implement a new model?

If you want to create a new implementation of a kind of model you must extend
the classes of the corresponding interfaces.

For instance, if you want to add a new cup model called `Plop`, create two files
cpu_plop.hpp and cpu_plop_cpp which contains classes CpuPlopModel, CpuPlop and
CpuPlopAction implementing respectively the interfaces CpuModel, Cpu and
CpuAction. You also need to define an initializing function like this:

~~~~
void surf_cpu_model_init_plop()
{
  xbt_assert(!surf_cpu_model_pm);

  surf_cpu_model_pm = new CpuPlopModel();

  simgrid::surf::on_postparse.connect(cpu_add_traces);

  xbt_dynar_push(model_list, &surf_cpu_model_pm);
}
~~~~

and add an entry in the corresponding array in surf_interface.cpp

~~~~
s_surf_model_description_t surf_cpu_model_description[] = {
  {"Cas01",
   "Simplistic CPU model (time=size/speed).",
   surf_cpu_model_init_Cas01},
  {"Plop",
   "The new plop CPU model.",
   surf_cpu_model_init_plop},
  {NULL, NULL, NULL}      // this array must be NULL terminated
};
~~~~

@subsection simgrid_dev_guide_model_kind How to add a new kind of model?

If you want to create a new kind of model, you must create a new interface
where you extend the classes Model, Resource and Action, and then create an
implementation of this interface.


@section simgrid_dev_guide_surf_callbacks How to use surf callbacks?

Adding features to surf could also be handle by using surf callbacks (instead
of adding new implementation model). The list of available callbacks is
accessible there @ref SURF_callbacks. An example of using surf callbacks is the
energy plugin. If you want to add a plugin you need to define callback function
and to connect them to callbacks handler in an initialization function.

~~~~
static void MyNetworkLinkCreatedCallback(NetworkLinkPtr cpu){
  // your code
}

static void MyNetworkLinkDestructedCallback(NetworkLinkPtr cpu){
  // your code
}

static void MyNetworkCommunicationCallback(NetworkActionPtr cpu,
                                           RoutingEdgePtr src,
                                           RoutingEdgePtr dst){
  // your code
}

void sg_my_network_plugin_init() {
  networkLinkCreatedCallbacks.connect(MyNetworkLinkCreatedCallback);
  networkLinkDestructedCallbacks.connect(MyNetworkLinkDestructedCallback);
  networkCommunicationCallbacks.connect(MyNetworkCommunicationCallback);
}
~~~~

Then you need to add an entry in surf_interface.cpp referring to your
initialization function.

~~~~
s_surf_model_description_t surf_plugin_description[] = {
                  {"Energy",
                   "Cpu energy consumption.",
                   sg_host_energy_plugin_init},
                  {"MyNetworkPlugin",
                   "My network plugin.",
                   sg_my_network_plugin_init},
                  {NULL, NULL, NULL}      // this array must be NULL terminated
};
~~~~

@section simgrid_dev_guide_simcall How to add a new simcall?

First of all you might want to avoid defining a new simcall if possible:
@ref simgrid_dev_guide_generic_simcall.

A simcall is used to go from user mode to kernel mode. There is some
sort of popping dance involved, as we want to isolate the user
contextes from their environment (so that they can run in parallel and
so that we can model-check them).

In short, just add a line to src/simix/simcalls.in and run the
src/simix/simcalls.py script. It will guide you about how to implement
your simcall. Please keep reading this section (only) if you want to
understand how it goes.


The workflow of a simcall is the following:

- `<ret> simcall_<name>(<args>)`
 - `simcall_BODY_<name>(<args>)`
  - Initializes the simcall (store the arguments in position)
  - If maestro, executes the simcall directly (and return)
  - If not, call `ActorImpl::yield` to give back the control to maestro
  - ========== KERNEL MODE ==========
  - `ActorImpl::simcall_handle` large switch (on simcall) doing for each:
   - `simcall_HANDLER_<name>(simcall, <args>)` (the manual code handling the simcall)
   - If the simcall is not marked as "blocking" in its definition,
     call `ActorImpl::simcall_answer()` that adds back the issuer
     process to the list of processes to run in the next scheduling round.
     It is thus the responsibility of the blocking simcalls to call
     `ActorImpl::simcall_answer()` themselves in their handler.

Note that empty HANDLERs can be omitted. These functions usually do
some parameter checking, or retrieve some information about the
simcall issuer, but when there no need for such things, the handler
can be omitted. In that case, we directly call the function
`simcall_<name>(<args>)`.

To simplify the simcall creation, a python script generates most of
the code and give helpers for the remaining stuff. That script reads
the simcall definitions from src/simix/simcalls.in, checks that both
`simcall_<name>()` and `simcall_HANDLER()` are defined somewhere, and
generates the following files:

- popping_accessors.hpp:
  Helper functions to get and set simcall arguments and results
- popping_bodies.cpp:
  The BODY function of each simcall
- popping_enum.hpp:
  Definition of type `enum class Simcall` (one value per existing simcall)
- popping_generated.cpp:
  Definitions of `simcall_names[]` (debug name of each simcall), and
  ActorImpl::simcall_handle() that deals with the simcall from within the kernel

The simcall.in file list all the simcalls in sections. A line starting by "##"
define a new section which will be replace by a "ifdef" in the generated code.

@section simgrid_dev_guide_generic_simcall How to avoid adding a new simcall?

We now have some generic simcalls which can be used to interface with the
Maestro without creating new simcalls. You might want to use them instead of
the defining additional simcalls.  The long term goal is to replace most of
the simcalls with the generic ones.

For simcalls which never block, `kernelImmediate()` can be used. It takes a
C++ callback executes it in maestro. Any value returned by the callback is
returned by `kernelImmediate()`. Conversely, if the callback throws an
exception, this exception is propagated out of `kernelImmediate()`. Executing
the code in maestro enforces mutual exclusion (no other user process is running)
and enforce a deterministic order which guarantees the reproducibility of the
simulation.  This call is particularly useful for implementing mutable calls:

~~~
void Host::setProperty(const char*key, const char *value){
  simgrid::simix::kernelImmediate([&] {
    simgrid::surf::HostImpl* surf_host = this->extension<simgrid::surf::HostImpl>();
    surf_host->setProperty(key,value);
  });
}
~~~

If there is no blocking and no mutation involved (getters), you might consider
avoiding switching to Maestro and reading directly the data you're interested
in.

For simcalls which might block, `kernel_sync()` can be used. It takes a
C++ callback and executes it immediately in maestro. This C++ callback is
expected to return a `simgrid::kernel::Future<T>` reprensenting the operation
in the kernel. When the operations completes, the user process is waken up
with the result:

~~~
try {
  std::vector<char> result = simgrid::simix::kernel_sync([&] {
    // Fictional example, simgrid::kernel::readFile does not exist.
    simgrid::kernel::Future<std::vector<char>> result = simgrid::kernel::readFile(file);
    return result;
  });
  XBT_DEBUG("Finished reading file %s: length %zu", file, result.size());
}
// If the operation failed, kernel_sync() throws an exception:
catch (std::runtime_error& e) {
  XBT_ERROR("Could not read file %s", file);
}
~~~

Asynchronous blocks can be implemented with `kernel_async()`. It works
like `kernel_sync()` but does not block. Instead, it returns a
`simgrid::simix::Future` representing the operation in the process:

~~~
simgrid::simix::Future<std:vector<char>> result = simgrid::simix::kernel_sync([&] {
  // Fictional example, simgrid::kernel::readFile does not exist.
  simgrid::kernek::Future<std::vector<char>> result = simgrid::kernel::readFile(file);
  return result;
};

// Do some work while the operation is pending:
while (!result.is_ready() && hasWorkToDo())
  doMoreWork();

// We don't have anything to do, wait for the operation to complete and
// get its value:
try {
  std:vector<char> data = result.get();
  XBT_DEBUG("Finished reading file %s: length %zu", file, data.size());
}
// If the operation failed, .get() throws an exception:
catch (std::runtime_error& e) {
  XBT_ERROR("Could not read file %s", file);
}
~~~

<b>Note:</b> `kernel_sync(f)` could be implemented as `kernel_async(f).get()`.

@section simgrid_dev_guide_tag What is How to add a new tag for xml files?

You should not do something like that. Please work instead to make XML
avoidable, ie to make the C++ interface nice and usable.
