\section simgrid_dev_guide_model How to add a new model in surf?
The figure below shows the architecture of the SURF layer. This layer is composed
of different kinds of models representing the different systems we want to
model (i.e., cpu, network, storage, workstation, virtual machine).

A model in simgrid is composed of three classes: Model, Resource and Action
(\ref SURF_interface "surf_interface.hpp").

\image latex surf++.pdf "surf++" width=\textwidth

Actually there are five kind of models: CpuModel, NetworkModel, WorkstationModel,
WorkstationVMModel and StorageModel. For each kind of model, there is an
interface (e.g.: \ref SURF_cpu_interface "cpu_interface.hpp") and some implementations (e.g.: cpu_cas01.hpp,
cpu_ti.hpp).

The CPU model Cas01, for instance, is initialized by the function
    void surf_cpu_model_init_Cas01()

The different network models that are offered by simgrid are stored in the array
that is defined as follows:

s_surf_model_description_t surf_network_model_description[] = {

\subsection simgrid_dev_guide_model_implem How to add a new model implementation in surf?

If you want to create a new implementation of a kind of model you must extend
the classes of the corresponding interfaces.

For instance, if you want to add a new cup model called `Plop`, create two files
cpu_plop.hpp and cpu_plop_cpp which contains classes CpuPlopModel, CpuPlop and
CpuPlopAction implementating respectively the interfaces CpuModel, Cpu and
CpuAction. You also need to define a initializing function like this:

~~~~
void surf_cpu_model_init_plop()
{
  xbt_assert(!surf_cpu_model_pm);

  surf_cpu_model_pm = new CpuPlopModel();

  sg_platf_postparse_add_cb(cpu_add_traces);

  xbt_dynar_push(model_list, &surf_cpu_model_pm);
}
~~~~

and add an entry in the corresponding array in surf_interface.cpp

~~~~
s_surf_model_description_t surf_cpu_model_description[] = {
  {"Cas01",
   "Simplistic CPU model (time=size/power).",
   surf_cpu_model_init_Cas01},
  {"Plop",
   "The new plop CPU model.",
   surf_cpu_model_init_plop},
  {NULL, NULL, NULL}      // this array must be NULL terminated
};
~~~~

\subsection simgrid_dev_guide_model_kind How to add a new kind of model in surf?

If you want to create a new kind of model, you must create a new interface
where you extend the classes Model, Resource and Action, and then create an
implementation of this interface.


\section simgrid_dev_guide_surf_callbacks How to use surf callbacks?

Adding features to surf could also be handle by using surf callbacks (instead
of adding new implementation model). The list of available callbacks is
accessible there \ref SURF_callbacks. An example of using surf callbacks is the
energy plugin. If you want to add a plugin you need to define callback function
and to connect them to callbacks handler in an initialization function.

~~~~
static void MyNetworkLinkCreatedCallback(NetworkLinkPtr cpu){
  // your code
}

static void MyNetworkLinkDestructedCallback(NetworkLinkPtr cpu){
  // your code
}

static void MyNetworkCommunicationCallback(NetworkActionPtr cpu,
                                           RoutingEdgePtr src,
                                           RoutingEdgePtr dst){
  // your code
}

void sg_my_network_plugin_init() {
  surf_callback_connect(networkLinkCreatedCallbacks,
                        MyNetworkLinkCreatedCallback);
  surf_callback_connect(networkLinkDestructedCallbacks,
                        MyNetworkLinkDestructedCallback);
  surf_callback_connect(networkCommunicationCallbacks,
                        MyNetworkCommunicationCallback);
}
~~~~

Then you need to add an entry in surf_interface.cpp refering to your
initialization function.

~~~~
s_surf_model_description_t surf_plugin_description[] = {
                  {"Energy",
                   "Cpu energy consumption.",
                   sg_energy_plugin_init},
                  {"MyNetworkPlugin",
                   "My network plugin.",
                   sg_my_network_plugin_init},
                  {NULL, NULL, NULL}      // this array must be NULL terminated
};
~~~~

\section simgrid_dev_guide_simcall How to add a new simcall?

A simcall is used to go from user mode to kernel mode. There is some
sort of popping dance involved, as we want to isolate the user
contextes from their environment (so that they can run in parallel).

The workflow of a simcall is the following:

- `<ret> simcall_<name>(<args>)`
 - `simcall_BODY_<name>(<args>)`
  - Initializes the simcall (store the arguments in position)
  - If maestro, executes the simcall directly (and return)
  - If not, call `SIMIX_process_yield` to give back the control to maestro
  - ========== KERNEL MODE ==========
  - `SIMIX_simcall_handle` large switch (on simcall) doing for each:
   - `simcall_HANDLER_<name>(simcall, <args>)` (the manual code handling the simcall)
   - If the simcall is not marked as "blocking" in its definition,
     call `SIMIX_simcall_answer(simcall)` that adds back the issuer
     process to the list of processes to run in the next scheduling round.
     It is thus the responsability of the blocking simcalls to call
     `SIMIX_simcall_answer(simcall)` themselves in their handler.

Note that empty HANDLERs can be omitted. These functions usually do
some parameter checking, or retrieve some information about the
simcall issuer, but when there no need for such things, the handler
can be omited. In that case, we directly call the function
`simcall_<name>(<args>)`.

To simplify the simcall creation, a python script generates most of
the code and give helpers for the remaining stuff. That script reads
the simcall definitions from src/simix/simcalls.in, checks that both
`simcall_<name>()` and `simcall_HANDLER()` are defined somewhere, and
generates the following files:

- smx_popping_accessors.h:
  Helper functions to get and set simcall arguments and results
- smx_popping_bodies.c:
  The BODY function of each simcall
- smx_popping_enum.c:
  Definition of type `enum e_smx_simcall_t` (one value per existing simcall)
- smx_popping_generated.c:
  Definitions of `simcall_names[]` (debug name of each simcall), and
  SIMIX_simcall_enter() that deals with the simcall from within the kernel

The simcall.in file list all the simcalls in sections. A line starting by "##"
define a new section which will be replace by a "ifdef" in the generated code.
There is a simcall by line which follow this format:

~~~~
Simcall -> Name HasAnswer Res Args
Name -> [a-z0-9_]+
Has_Answer -> "True" | "False"
Res -> "(" Type MaybeCast ")"
Args -> Args Arg | Arg
Arg -> "(" Name "," Type MaybeCast ")"
Type -> "char" | "const char*" | "int" | "long" | "unsigned char" | "unsigned short" | "unsigned int" | "unsigned long" | "float" | "double" | "void*" | "FPtr" | "const void*" | "size_t" | "sg_size_t" | "void" | "void*"
MaybeCast -> "," Cast | ""
Cast -> [a-z0-9_* ]+
