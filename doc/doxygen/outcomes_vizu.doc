/*! @page outcomes_vizu Visualization and Statistical Analysis

SimGrid comes with an extensive support to trace and register what
happens during the simulation, so that it can be either visualized or
statistically analysed after the simulation.

This tracing is widely used to observe and understand the behavior of
parallel applications and distributed algorithms. Usually, this is
done in a two-step fashion: the user instruments the application and
the traces are analyzed after the end of the execution. The analysis
can highlights unexpected behaviors, bottlenecks and sometimes can be
used to correct distributed algorithms. The SimGrid team has
instrumented the library in order to let users trace their simulations
and analyze them. This part of the user manual explains how the
tracing-related features can be enabled and used during the
development of simulators using the SimGrid library.

@section instr_category_functions Tracing categories functions

The SimGrid library is instrumented so users can trace the platform
utilization using MSG, SimDAG and SMPI interfaces. It registers how
much power is used for each host and how much bandwidth is used for
each link of the platform. The idea with this type of tracing is to
observe the overall view of resources utilization in the first place,
especially the identification of bottlenecks, load-balancing among
hosts, and so on.

Another possibility is to trace resource utilization by
categories. Categorized resource utilization tracing gives SimGrid
users to possibility to classify MSG and SimDAG tasks by category,
tracing resource utilization for each of the categories. The functions
below let the user declare a category and apply it to tasks. <em>The
tasks that are not classified according to a category are not
traced</em>. Even if the user does not specify any category, the
simulations can still be traced in terms of resource utilization by
using a special parameter that is detailed below (see section @ref
tracing_tracing_options).

@section tracing_tracing_options Tracing configuration Options

To check which tracing options are available for your simulator, you
can just run it with the option @verbatim --help-tracing @endverbatim
to get a very detailed and updated explanation of each tracing
parameter. These are some of the options accepted by the tracing
system of SimGrid, you can use them by running your simulator with the
<b>--cfg=</b> switch:

@li <b>@c
tracing
</b>:
  Safe switch. It activates (or deactivates) the tracing system.
  No other tracing options take effect if this one is not activated.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/categorized
</b>:
  It activates the categorized resource utilization tracing. It should
  be enabled if tracing categories are used by this simulator.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/categorized:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/uncategorized
</b>:
  It activates the uncategorized resource utilization tracing. Use it if
  this simulator do not use tracing categories and resource use have to be
  traced.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/uncategorized:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/filename
</b>:
  A file with this name will be created to register the simulation. The file
  is in the Paje format and can be analyzed using Paje visualization
  tools. More information can be found in these webpages:
     <a href="http://github.com/schnorr/pajeng/">http://github.com/schnorr/pajeng/</a>
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/filename:mytracefile.trace
@endverbatim
  If you do not provide this parameter, the trace file will be named simgrid.trace.

@li <b>@c
tracing/smpi
</b>:
  This option only has effect if this simulator is SMPI-based. Traces the MPI
  interface and generates a trace that can be analyzed using Gantt-like
  visualizations. Every MPI function (implemented by SMPI) is transformed in a
  state, and point-to-point communications can be analyzed with arrows.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/smpi:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/smpi/group
</b>:
  This option only has effect if this simulator is SMPI-based. The processes
  are grouped by the hosts where they were executed.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/smpi/group:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/smpi/computing
</b>:
  This option only has effect if this simulator is SMPI-based. The parts external
to SMPI are also outputted to the trace. Provides better way to analyze the data automatically.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/smpi/computing:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/smpi/internals
</b>:
  This option only has effect if this simulator is SMPI-based. Display internal communications
happening during a collective MPI call.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/smpi/internals:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/smpi/display-sizes
</b>:
  This option only has effect if this simulator is SMPI-based. Display the sizes of the messages
exchanged in the trace, both in the links and on the states. For collective, size means the global size of data sent by the process in general.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/smpi/display-sizes:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/actor
</b>:
  This option traces the behavior of all categorized actors, grouping them by hosts. This option
  can be used to track actor location if this simulator has actor migration.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/actor:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/buffer
</b>:
 This option put some events in a time-ordered buffer using the
 insertion sort algorithm. The process of acquiring and releasing
 locks to access this buffer and the cost of the sorting algorithm
 make this process slow. The simulator performance can be severely
 impacted if this option is activated, but you are sure to get a trace
 file with events sorted.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/buffer:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/onelink-only
</b>:
This option changes the way SimGrid register its platform on the trace
file. Normally, the tracing considers all routes (no matter their
size) on the platform file to re-create the resource topology. If this
option is activated, only the routes with one link are used to
register the topology within a netzone. Routes among netzones continue to be
traced as usual.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/onelink-only:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/disable-link
</b>:

@verbatim
TODO
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/disable-power
</b>:
TODO
@verbatim
TODO
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/disable-destroy
</b>:
Disable the destruction of containers at the end of simulation. This
can be used with simulators that have a different notion of time
(different from the simulated time).
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/disable-destroy:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/basic
</b>:
Some visualization tools are not able to parse correctly the Paje file format.
Use this option if you are using one of these tools to visualize the simulation
trace. Keep in mind that the trace might be incomplete, without all the
information that would be registered otherwise.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/basic:yes
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/comment
</b>:
Use this to add a comment line to the top of the trace file.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/comment:my_string
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/comment-file
</b>:
Use this to add the contents of a file to the top of the trace file as comment.
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/comment-file:textual_file.txt
@endverbatim

@li <b>@c
tracing/precision
</b>:
This option determines the precision of timings stored in the trace file. Make sure
you set @ref options_model_precision to at least the same value as this option! (Traces
cannot be more accurate than the simulation; they can be less accurate, though.)

The following example will give you a precision of E-10 in the trace file:
@verbatim
--cfg=tracing/precision:10
@endverbatim

Please pass @verbatim --help-tracing @endverbatim to your simulator
for the updated list of tracing options.

@section tracing_tracing_example_parameters Case studies

Some scenarios that might help you decide which tracing options
you should use to analyze your simulator.

@li I want to trace the resource utilization of all hosts
and links of the platform, and my simulator <b>does not</b> use
the tracing API. For that, you can run a uncategorized trace
with the following parameters (it will work with <b>any</b> Simgrid
simulator):
@verbatim
./your_simulator @
          --cfg=tracing:yes @
          --cfg=tracing/uncategorized:yes @
          --cfg=tracing/filename:mytracefile.trace @
@endverbatim

@li I want to trace only a subset of my MSG (or SimDAG) tasks.
For that, you will need to create tracing categories using the
<b>TRACE_category (...)</b> function (as explained above),
and then classify your tasks to a previously declared category
using the <b>MSG_task_set_category (...)</b>
(or <b>SD_task_set_category (...)</b> for SimDAG tasks). After
recompiling, run your simulator with the following parameters:
@verbatim
./your_simulator @
          --cfg=tracing:yes @
          --cfg=tracing/categorized:yes @
          --cfg=tracing/filename:mytracefile.trace @
@endverbatim


@section tracing_tracing_example Example of Instrumentation

A simplified example using the tracing mandatory functions.

@verbatim
int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
  MSG_init (&argc, &argv);

  //(... after deployment ...)

  //note that category declaration must be called after MSG_create_environment
  TRACE_category_with_color ("request", "1 0 0");
  TRACE_category_with_color ("computation", "0.3 1 0.4");
  TRACE_category ("finalize");

  msg_task_t req1 = MSG_task_create("1st_request_task", 10, 10, NULL);
  msg_task_t req2 = MSG_task_create("2nd_request_task", 10, 10, NULL);
  msg_task_t req3 = MSG_task_create("3rd_request_task", 10, 10, NULL);
  msg_task_t req4 = MSG_task_create("4th_request_task", 10, 10, NULL);
  MSG_task_set_category (req1, "request");
  MSG_task_set_category (req2, "request");
  MSG_task_set_category (req3, "request");
  MSG_task_set_category (req4, "request");

  msg_task_t comp = MSG_task_create ("comp_task", 100, 100, NULL);
  MSG_task_set_category (comp, "computation");

  msg_task_t finalize = MSG_task_create ("finalize", 0, 0, NULL);
  MSG_task_set_category (finalize, "finalize");

  //(...)

  MSG_clean();
  return 0;
}
@endverbatim

@section tracing_tracing_analyzing Analyzing SimGrid Simulation Traces

A SimGrid-based simulator, when executed with the correct parameters
(see above) creates a trace file in the Paje file format holding the
simulated behavior of the application or the platform. You have
several options to analyze this trace file:

- Dump its contents to a CSV-like format using `pj_dump` (see <a
  href="https://github.com/schnorr/pajeng/wiki/pj_dump">PajeNG's wiki
  on pj_dump</a> and more generally the <a
  href="https://github.com/schnorr/pajeng/">PajeNG suite</a>) and use
  gnuplot to plot resource usage, time spent on blocking/executing
  functions, and so on. Filtering capabilities are at your hand by
  doing `grep`, with the best regular expression you can provide, to
  get only parts of the trace (for instance, only a subset of
  resources or processes).

- Derive statistics from trace metrics (the ones built-in with any
  SimGrid simulation, but also those metrics you injected in the trace
  using the TRACE module) using the <a
  href="http://www.r-project.org/">R project</a> and all its
  modules. You can also combine R with <a
  href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> to get a number of high
  quality plots from your simulation metrics. You need to `pj_dump`
  the contents of the SimGrid trace file to use R.

- Visualize the behavior of your simulation using classic space/time
  views (gantt-charts) provided by the <a
  href="https://github.com/schnorr/pajeng/">PajeNG suite</a> and any
  other tool that supports the <a
  href="http://paje.sourceforge.net/download/publication/lang-paje.pdf">Paje
  file format</a>. Consider this option if you need to understand the
  causality of your distributed simulation.

- You can also check our online <a
  href="https://simgrid.org/tutorials.html"> tutorial
  section</a> that contains a dedicated tutorial with several
  suggestions on how to use the tracing infrastructure. Look for the
  SimGrid User::Visualization 101 tutorial.

- Ask for help on the <a
  href="mailto:simgrid-community@inria.fr">simgrid-community@inria.fr</a>
  mailing list, giving us a detailed explanation on what your
  simulator does and what kind of information you want to trace. You
  can also check the <a
  href="http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/simgrid-user/">mailing
  list archive</a> for old messages regarding tracing and analysis.
