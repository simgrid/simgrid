\section inside_release_c Releasing the main library

\subsection inside_release_c_preconditions Before releasing

Please apply the following checklist before releasing.

- Sources
  - The version number is correctly marked in CMakeList.txt, in macros
    SIMGRID_VERSION_MAJOR and friends. Please also update the
    comments right before these macros so that we keep a track of the
    version numbers that were used.
  - The" make distcheck" target works (testing that every files needed
    to build and install are included in the archive)
  - The version number provided to download in the examples of
    doc/doxygen/install.doc is accurate (we should maybe generate this
    file to avoid issues, but some inaccuracies are less painful than
    editing the cmake files to make this happen, sorry).
- Tests
  - All tests pass on a reasonable amount of platforms (typically,
    everything on cdash)
  - You also tested to build and install the content of the source
    archive on a reasonable amount of platforms (typically, 2 or 3).
- ChangeLog file
  - Every changes are documented
  - The release date is indicated below the changes
  - The release is marked as stable above the changes
  - The release dub name matches the one given in NEWS file
- NEWS
  - The most notable changes of the version are documented
  - The release date is indicated right below the version name
  - The release dub name matches the one given in ChangeLog file

\subsection inside_release_c_source Building the source archive

First, clean up your git repository. Some files are included through
globbing, you must ensure that your tree contains no cruft. You can
either checkout a new tree or remove anything from your current tree:
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ git reset --hard master # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
$ git clean -dfx          # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
\endverbatim

You can then build the archive. This gives you your archive in the
build dir, named 'SimGrid-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz'.

\verbatim
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_win32 Binary distribution under Win32

You have to install nsis tool first. Download it 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download">here</a>.

Then be sure having wget.exe in your path to get the online documentation. You can download it 
<a href="http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/">here</a>.

You can finally make the win installer.
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make nsis
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_postchecks Check list after releasing

- Tag the git repository (don't forget to push the tags to the main
  repo)
- Push the archive files on gforge
- Rebuild and resynchronize the website so that the file gets visible
  from our download page (see @ref inside_doxygen_website).
- Update the link ff-scm-v4-prod:/home/groups/simgrid/htdocs/simgrid/latest
- Announce the release
 - Mail the simgrid-user mailing list
    - the NEWS chunk in the mail;
    - the ChangeLog chunk as attachment
 - Also mail some other lists (G5K users), with only the NEWS chunk
   and the link to the download section

\section inside_release_bindings Releasing the bindings

Please apply the above checklists before and after releasing the bindings.

Then, clean your git repository and build the archive. It will give
you an archive file in the build dir:
'SimGrid-Java-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz' or
'SimGrid-Ruby-${inside_release_version}.tar.gz'. 

\verbatim
$ cd simgrid-java (or simgrid-ruby)
$ git reset --hard master
$ git clean -dfx
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim
