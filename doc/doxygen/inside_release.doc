@page inside_release Releasing SimGrid

@section inside_release_c Releasing the main library

@subsection inside_release_c_preconditions Before releasing

Please apply the following checklist before releasing.

- Sources
  - The external patches (Debian, etc) are integrated.
    The COPYING file is aligned with Debian's copyright file, and the
    dates of SimGrid chunks are accurate.
- ChangeLog file
  - All changes are documented
  - The release date is indicated below the changes
  - The release is marked as stable above the changes (remove the UNRELEASED marker)
  - The release dub name matches the one given in NEWS file
- NEWS
  - The most notable changes of the version are documented
  - The release date is indicated right below the version name
  - The release dub name matches the one given in ChangeLog file
- Release notes in the documentation
  - The content of the future mail is part of the documentation, since
    we won't send mails once gforge is definitly turned off.
  - The date of the release is marked in the title
- Tests
  - The "make distcheck" target works (tested by jenkins)
  - All tests pass on everything on ci + AppVeyor
  - Tutorials and derivative projects build correctly
    https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid-template-s4u/pipelines
    https://framagit.org/simgrid/external-projects-ci/pipelines
  - The python module builds (see below).
  - The java jarfile builds from the github action

@subsection inside_release_c_releasing Actually releasing SimGrid

- Update the version number in:
  - CMakeLists.txt (in macros SIMGRID_VERSION_*)
  - sonar-project.properties
  - docs/source/conf.py
  - setup.py
- Commit and push to both framagit and github
- Wait for both appveyor and jenkins/osX to complete the build
- If it's not successful, fix it and push again
- Once it's successful everywhere: merge 'master' into 'stable' and push it to framagit
  - You can interrupt the build on jenkins, as it was tested just before
  - This builds the tar.gz artefact.

- Download the simgrid-doc-3.X.Y (artefact of pipeline 'pages' on framagit)
  Download the tgz file (artefact of the pipeline 'stable' on framagit)
  Build the jar file using the github action
- Tag the git repository v3.XX.X and push it to framagit and ghub
- Document the tag on framagit and ghub
  - Upload the files simgrid-3.XX.tar.gz, simgrid-3_XX.jar and simgrid-doc-3_XX.zip
  - Add a link to the version of the ChangeLog that comes with this tag.
    https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/-/blob/v3.29/ChangeLog
- Update the website
  - emacs org/org-templates/level-0.org to change the release version, the tgz link and the jar link.
  - jed .gitlab-ci.yml
    - Change the link to the simgrid-doc-3_XX.zip file
    - Only keep 2 old versions so that people don't find older ones in google
    - Change the link to latest
  - git commit -a && git push # Check that the pipeline goes well on framagit

- Rebuild and upload the python package
  - rm -rf dist/ ; python3 setup.py sdist # Build a source distrib
  - test that the built distrib recompiles:
    rm -rf /tmp/pysimgrid && mkdir /tmp/pysimgrid && cp dist/simgrid-*.tar.gz /tmp/pysimgrid
    (cd /tmp/pysimgrid && tar xfz simgrid*.tar.gz && cd simgrid-*/ && python3 setup.py build)
  - Upload it to pypi (WARNING: you cannot modify uploaded files, ever)
    twine upload dist/simgrid-*.tar.gz

@subsection inside_release_c_publishing Publishing the release if it's a stable one (3.XX not 3.XX.Y)

- Announce the release
 - Mail the simgrid-user mailing list
    - the NEWS chunk in the mail;
    - Hall of Fame in the mail
      git shortlog -se v3.29..
    - Link to the ChangeLog on framagit (the version of that tag)
 - Also mail some other lists (G5K users)
- Release the debian package
  - rm -f ../simgrid_3.*+dfsg.orig.tar.xz
  - uscan # download the new version
  - gbp import-orig ../simgrid_3.*+dfsg.orig.tar.xz
  - dch -i "New upstream release" # + copy the NEWS into debian/changelog
  - git mv debian/libsimgrid3.XX.install debian/libsimgrid3.XY.install
  - edit debian/control: s/simgrid3.XX/simgrid3.XY/
- Update the simgrid/package.py for spack: https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/spack-repo
- Push the stable branch to github to rebuild and push the stable Docker images
  - It downloads the latest tag on framagit
  - Doing the same manually: cd tools/docker && make stable && make tuto-s4u tuto-smpi
    (tuto-mc is not based on simgrid/stable but rebuilds from the git)
  - Once the new images are built, trigger a rebuild of the simgrid-template-{s4u,smpi} repositories on framagit
- Add the new simgrid/stable image to the .gitlab-ci.yml of:
  - https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid-template-s4u/
  - https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid-template-smpi/

@subsection inside_release_c_postrelease Post-release cleanups

- Create the template for the next release in ChangeLog and NEWS files
  Release Target date: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox
- Bump release number to 3.X.1 in CMakeLists.txt sonar-project.properties docs/source/conf.py setup.py
- Deal with deprecations:
  - jed include/xbt/base.h: Introduce the next XBT_ATTRIB_DEPRECATED_v??? macro
  - Kill the one for the current release and remove all code that were
    mandated by the deprecated functions (both in source and headers).
  - Do the possible cleanups now that these features are gone.

Release numbering semantic:
  - 3.X is a named release.
    - We have 4 named releases per year (for each equinox and solstice)
    - The ChangeLog and NEWS are complete and informative
    - All tests pass on all ci systems (or the workarounds are documented)
    - We provide and store a source .tar.gz and a full jarfile on framagit
    - Deprecated symbols remain usable for at least 3 named releases (~1 year)
    - These releases are announced to the users
  - 3.X.Y where Y is even: dot release of 3.X, prerelease of 3.(X+1)
    - We provide and store a source .tar.gz and a full jarfile on framagit
    - These releases are NOT announced publicly, nor really documented.
      The idea is to have something close to a rolling release.
    - External projects can depend on dot releases to loosen their
      release process from ours, when 4 release a year is not enough
  - 3.X.Y where Y is odd: git current status between two releases
    - No expectations on such versions
  - Example
    - 3.22.4: unannounced/loosely documented stable release
    - 3.22.5: git status somewhere between the release of 3.22.4 and the next one
    - 3.23: Documented and announced stable release
