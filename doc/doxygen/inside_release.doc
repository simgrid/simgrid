\section inside_release_c Releasing the main library

\subsection inside_release_c_preconditions Before releasing

Please apply the following checklist before releasing.

- Sources
  - The external patches (Debian, etc) are integrated.
    The COPYING file is aligned with Debian's copyright file.
  - The version number is correctly marked in CMakeLists.txt, in macros
    SIMGRID_VERSION_MAJOR and friends. 
  - The "make distcheck" target works (testing that every files needed
    to build and install are included in the archive)
- Tests
  - All tests pass on a reasonable amount of platforms (typically,
    everything on ci)
  - You also tested to build and install the content of the source
    archive on a reasonable amount of platforms (typically, 2 or 3).
- ChangeLog file
  - All changes are documented
  - The release date is indicated below the changes
  - The release is marked as stable above the changes (remove the UNRELEASED marker)
  - The release dub name matches the one given in NEWS file
- NEWS
  - The most notable changes of the version are documented
  - The release date is indicated right below the version name
  - The release dub name matches the one given in ChangeLog file

\subsection inside_release_c_source Building the source archive

This should be done from a clean git repository because some files are
included through globbing. The best is to use a clean checkout:
\verbatim
cd /tmp
git clone --depth=1 ~/Code/simgrid
cd simgrid
cmake . && make dist
\endverbatim

If you prefer, you can clean your repository the hard way:
\verbatim
git reset --hard master # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
git clean -dfx          # warning, it will kill your uncommited changes
cmake . && make dist
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_release_c_jarfile Building the binary jarfile

Get the jarfiles for several OSes on the CI slaves. Use Save under to
give a separate name to each of them.

- On Jenkins: Mac OSX, Linux 64 and Linux 32 (without boost-context), FreeBSD, NetBSD
- On AppVeyor: Windows 

Once all jarfiles are in a separate directory, run the following to
merge them:
\verbatim
mkdir content ; cd content

for j in  ../simgrid-linux64.jar ../*.jar ; do unzip -n $j ; done
# The content of all jar should be the same, but I prefer using the Linux64 version by default
#  => unpack it first, and unpack the others with -n (never overwrite)

test -e doc/javadoc || echo "YOU ARE MISSING THE DOC"

du -sh .                                  # 273M here. Let's strip (Darwin is already good)
strip NATIVE/*/*/*.so                     # Gets BSD and Linux versions, down to 116M
x86_64-linux-gnu-strip NATIVE/*/*/lib*dll # Gets Windows, down to 22M

rm ../simgrid-3_*.jar
zip -r ../simgrid-3_XX.jar *              # Produced ../simgrid-3_XX.jar is 7.7M
\endverbatim

To upload the file on gforge, you need to go to Files/Admin then clic
on the Settings icon near to the "Add a version" button, and then on
the settings icon of the release you want to change.

\subsection inside_release_c_postchecks Check list after releasing

- Tag the git repository (don't forget to push the tags to the main repo)
- Push the archive files (tar.gz and jar) on gforge
- Post a news on gforge (before updating the website)
- Update the link scm.gforge.inria.fr:/home/groups/simgrid/htdocs/simgrid/latest
  (and create the directory of the next version)
- Rebuild and resynchronize the website so that the file gets visible
  from our download page.\n
  - Edit org/org-templates/level-0.org to change the release version, the tgz link and the jar link.
  - emacs org/site/index.org and C-c C-c the first source block to refresh the news.
  - emacs org/site/download.org and C-c C-c the first source block to refresh the download.

  - make -C org all sync
  - git commit -a && git push
- Announce the release
 - Document the tag on https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid/releases

    - the NEWS chunk in the mail;
    - the ChangeLog chunk as attachment
 - Also mail some other lists (G5K users), with only the NEWS chunk
   and the link to the download section
- Release the debian package
- Update the simgrid/package.py for spack: https://github.com/solverstack/spack
