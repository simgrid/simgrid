/*! @page install_yours Setup your own project

@tableofcontents

It is not advised to modify the simgrid source code directly, as it
will make it difficult to upgrade to the next version of SimGrid.
Instead, you should create your own working directory somewhere on
your disk (say `/home/joe/MyFirstScheduler/`), and write your code in
there. 

Then, you should find a solution to get your code compiled and linked
to the SimGrid library as needed. This page helps you to do so with
several tools: 
@ref install_yours_cmake "CMake" and
@ref install_yours_makefile "Makefile."
If you configure your project with a tool that is not listed here,
we'd be glad to hear how you've done that to extend this
documentation.

@section install_yours_cmake Building your project with CMake

Here is a `CMakeLists.txt` that you can use as a starting point for
your project. It builds two simulators from a given set of source files.

You first need to copy the `FindSimGrid.cmake` (at the root of the
SimGrid tree) into the `cmake/Modules` directory of your project.

@verbatim
project(MyFirstScheduler)

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")

set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/Modules/")
find_package(SimGrid REQUIRED)
include_directories(${SimGrid_INCLUDE_DIR})

set(SIMULATOR_SOURCES main.c other.c util.c)
add_executable(my_simulator ${SIMULATOR_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(my_simulator ${SimGrid_LIBRARY})

set(OTHER_SOURCES blah.c bar.c foo.h)
add_executable(other_xp ${OTHER_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(other_xp ${SimGrid_LIBRARY})
@endverbatim

@section install_yours_makefile Building your project with Makefile

Here is a Makefile that will work if your project is composed of three
C files named @c util.h, @c util.c and @c mysimulator.c. You should
take it as a starting point, and adapt it to your code. There is a
plenty of documentation and tutorial on Makefile if the file's
comments are not enough for you.

@verbatim
# The first rule of a Makefile is the default target. It will be built when make is called with no parameter
# Here, we want to build the binary 'mysimulator'
all: mysimulator

# This second rule lists the dependencies of the mysimulator binary
# How this dependencies are linked is described in an implicit rule below
mysimulator: mysimulator.o util.o

# These third give the dependencies of the each source file
mysimulator.o: mysimulator.c util.h # list every .h that you use
util.o: util.c util.h

# Some configuration
SIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH = /opt/simgrid # Where you installed simgrid

@section install_yours_cppeclipsedevenv Develop in C++ with SimGrid with Eclipse

If you wish to develop your plugin or modify SimGrid using Eclipse. You have to run cmake and import it as a Makefile project. 

Next you have to activate C++11 in your build settings, add -std=c++11 in the CDT GCC Built-in compiler settings.

@section install_yours_javaexample  Building the Java examples in Eclipse

If you want to build our Java examples in Eclipse, get the whole
source code and open the archive on your disk. In Eclipse, select
the menu "File / Import", and then in the wizard "General / Existing
Project into Workspace". On the Next page, select the directory
"examples/java" that you can find in the SimGrid source tree as a root
directory and finish the creation.

The file \c simgrid.jar must be in the root directory of the SimGrid
tree. That's where it is built by default, but if you don't want to
compile it yourself, just grab that file from the SimGrid website and
copy it in here.

Please note that once you better understand SimGrid, you should not
modify the examples directly but instead create your own project in
eclipse. This will make it easier to upgrade to another version of
SimGrid.

@section install_yours_trouble Troubleshooting your project setup

@subsection install_yours_trouble_libpath error while loading shared libraries: libsimgrid.so

Sometimes, the following error message (or similar) will be produced:
@verbatim
./masterworker1: error while loading shared libraries: libsimgrid.so:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
@endverbatim

The same problem can make the execution of your programs spit pages
and pages of errors similar to the following. If there is only a few
undefined references, then you want to read the next section.
@verbatim
masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `sg_version_check'
masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `MSG_init_nocheck'
(and many other undefined references)
@endverbatim

In both cases, it means that the system does not manage to find the
simgrid library when it tries to execute your programs. Under Linux,
specify where to search with the <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> variable.
Try running the following command before executing your code. If it
helps, you should add this line to your ~/.bashrc so that it gets
executed each time you log into your computer.

@verbatim
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/simgrid/lib
@endverbatim

@subsection install_yours_trouble_oldlib Only a few undefined references

Sometimes, the compilation only spits very few "undefined reference"
errors. A possible cause is that the system selected an old version of
the SimGrid library somewhere on your disk. 

Under Linux, you can find which version was used with the following
command that will display the full path to every used dynamic library.
Once you've found the obsolete copy of SimGrid, just erase it, and
recompile and relaunch your program.
@verbatim ldd yoursimulator
@endverbatim
