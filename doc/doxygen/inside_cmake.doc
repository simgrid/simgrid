\section inside_cmake_intro Generalities on Cmake

\subsection inside_cmake_what What is Cmake?

CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package
software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process
using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files.
CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in
the compiler environment of your choice. For more information see
official web site <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">here</a>.

\subsection inside_cmake_why Why cmake?

CMake permits to developers to compile projects on different
platforms. Then many tools are embedded like ctest for making test, a
link to cdash for vizualise results but also test coverage and bug
reports.

\section inside_cmake_addsrc How to add source files?

If you want modified, add or delete source files from a library you have to edit <project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/DefinePackages.cmake.
Chose the section you are interested in and modify it.

\verbatim
set(SMPI_SRC
  src/smpi/smpi_base.c
  src/smpi/smpi_bench.c
  src/smpi/smpi_c99.c
  src/smpi/smpi_coll.c
  src/smpi/smpi_comm.c
  src/smpi/smpi_global.c
  src/smpi/smpi_group.c
  src/smpi/smpi_mpi.c
  src/smpi/smpi_mpi_dt.c
  src/smpi/smpi_pmpi.c
  src/smpi/smpi_replay.c
  )
\endverbatim

If your source is always added to the library, you are set. But if
it's optional, you must ensure that it gets added to the source
distribution when not compiled in, or it may well be missing if the
archive is built without the option activating your source. This is
done by adding the files to the EXTRA_DIST list, as in the following
example:

\verbatim
### If f2c is installed compiled source other-whise source is only copy in the dist 
if(SMPI_F2C)
  set(SMPI_SRC
    ${SMPI_SRC}
    src/smpi/smpi_f77.c
    )
else()
  set(EXTRA_DIST
    ${EXTRA_DIST}
    src/smpi/smpi_f77.c
  )
endif()
\endverbatim

Don't forget to run the "make distcheck" target after any modification
to the cmake files: it checks whether all necessary files are present
in the distribution.

\section cmake_dev_guide_ex How to add examples?

First of all, are you sure that you want to create an example, or is
it merely a new test case? The examples located in examples/ must be
interesting to the users. It is expected that the users will take one
of these examples and start editing it to make it fit their needs. If
what you are about to write is merly a test, exercising a specific
part of the tool suite but not really interesting to the users, then
you want to add it to the teshsuite/ directory. 

Actually, the examples are also used as regresion tests by adding tesh
files and registering them to the testing infrastructure (for that,
don't forget to add a tesh file and follow the instructions of 
section \ref inside_cmake_addtest). The main difference is that
examples must be interesting to the users in addition.

In both cases, you have to create a CMakeList.txt in the chosen source
directory. It must specify where to create the executable, the source
list, dependencies and the name of the binary.

\verbatim
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}")

add_executable(Hello Hello.c)

### Add definitions for compile
target_link_libraries(Hello simgrid)

### You have to put all new files in the apropriated section 
### If they are not there, they can't be on the dist package. 
set(tesh_files
  ${tesh_files}
  PARENT_SCOPE
  )
set(xml_files
  ${xml_files}
  PARENT_SCOPE
  )
set(examples_src
  ${examples_src}
  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/Hello.c
  PARENT_SCOPE
  )
set(bin_files
  ${bin_files}
  PARENT_SCOPE
  )
set(txt_files
  ${txt_files}
  PARENT_SCOPE
  )
\endverbatim

Then, you have to follow these steps:
\li Add the following line to <project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/MakeExe.cmake:
\verbatim
add_subdirectory(${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/<path_where_is_CMakeList.txt>)
\endverbatim

\li Add your CMakeLists.txt to CMAKE_SOURCE_FILES in <project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/DefinePackages.cmake:
\verbatim
set(CMAKE_SOURCE_FILES
  CMakeLists.txt
  ....
  <path_to_your_CMakeList.txt>
  )
\endverbatim

\li if you add tesh files (and you should), please refer to the
following section to register them to the testing infrastructure.

Once you're done, you should check with "make distcheck" that you did
not forget to add any file to the distributed archives.

\section inside_cmake_addtest How to add tests?

\subsection inside_cmake_addtest_unit Unit testing in SimGrid

If you want to test a specific function or set of functions, you need
a unit test. Edit
<project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/UnitTesting.cmake to add your
source file to the TEST_CFILES list, and add the corresponding unit
file to the TEST_UNITS list. For example, if your file is toto.c,
your unit file will be toto_unit.c. The full path to your file must be
provided, but the unit file will always be in src/ directly.

Then, you want to actually add your tests in the source file. All the
tests must be protected by "#ifdef SIMGRID_TEST" so that they don't
get included in the regular build. Then, you want to add a test suite
that will contain a bunch of tests (in Junit, that would be a test
unit) with the macro #XBT_TEST_SUITE, and populate it with a bunch of
actual tests with the macro #XBT_TEST_UNIT (sorry for the mischosen
names if you are used to junit). Just look at the dynar example (or
any other) to see how it works in practice. Do not hesitate to stress
test your code this way, but make sure that it runs reasonably fast,
or nobody will run "ctest" before commiting code.

If you are interested in the mechanic turning this into an actual
test, check the <project/directory>/tools/sg_unit_extractor.pl script.

To actually run your tests once you're done, run "make testall", that
builds the binary containing all our unit tests and run it. This
binary allows you to chose which suite you want to test:

\verbatim
$ testall --help # revise how it goes if you forgot
$ testall --dump-only # learn about all existing test suites
$ testall --tests=-all # run no test at all
$ testall --tests=-all,+foo # run only the foo test suite.
$ testall --tests=-all,+foo:bar # run only the bar test from the foo suite.
$ testall --tests=-foo:bar # run all tests but the bar test from the foo suite.
\endverbatim

\subsection inside_cmake_addtest_integration Integration testing in SimGrid

If you want to test a full binary (such as an example), then you
probably want to use the tesh binary that ensures that the output
produced by a command perfectly matches the expected output. In
particular, this is very precious to ensure that no change modifies
the timings computed by the models without notice. 

The first step is to write a tesh file for your test, containing the
command to run, the provided input (if any, but almost no SimGrid test
provide such an input) and the expected output. Check the tesh man
page for more details. 

Tesh is sometimes annoying as you have to ensure that the expected
output will always be exactly the same. In particular, your should not
output machine dependent informations, nor memory adresses as they
would change on each run. Several steps can be used here, such as the
obfucation of the memory adresses unless the verbose logs are
displayed (using the #XBT_LOG_ISENABLED() macro), or the modification
of the log formats to hide the timings when they depend on the host
machine.

Then you have to request cmake to run your test when "ctest" is
launched. For that, you have to modify source
<project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/AddTests.cmake. Make sure to pick
a wise name for your test. It is often useful to check a category of
tests together. The only way to do so in ctest is to use the -R
argument that specifies a regular expression that the test names must
match. For example, you can run all MSG test with "ctest -R msg" That
explains the importance of the test names.

Once the name is chosen, create a new test by adding a line similar to
the following (assuming that you use tesh as expected).

\verbatim
#  ADD_TEST(test-name ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/tesh <options> <tesh-file>)
#  option --setenv bindir set the directory containing the binary
#         --setenv srcdir set the directory containing the source file
#         --cd set the working directory
ADD_TEST(my-test-name ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin/tesh 
         --setenv bindir=${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/examples/my-test/
         --setenv srcdir=${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/examples/my-test/
         --cd ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/examples/my-test/
         ${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/examples/msg/io/io.tesh
)
\endverbatim             

If you prefer to not use tesh for some reasons, prefer the following
form:

\verbatim
# ADD_TEST(NAME <name>]
#          [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
#          COMMAND <command> [arg1 [arg2 ...]])
ADD_TEST(NAME my-test-name 
         WORKING_DIRECTORY  ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/examples/my-test/
         COMMAND Hello
)
\endverbatim 

As usual, you must run "make distcheck" after modifying the cmake files,
to ensure that you did not forget any files in the distributed archive.

\subsection inside_cmake_addtest_perf Performance testing in SimGrid

We are currently in the process of adding an infrastructure for
performance regression testing, but this is not related to cmake
anyhow. They are thus documented elsewhere, in Section \ref
inside_autotests_perf
