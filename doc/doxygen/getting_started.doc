/*! @page getting_started Getting Started: SimGrid Main Concepts

@tableofcontents

SimGrid is a simulator of distributed computer systems. It can be used
to either assess abstract algorithms, or to profile and debug real
distributed applications.  SimGrid enables studies in the domains of
(data-)Grids, Clusters, IaaS Clouds, High Performance Computing,
Volunteer Computing and Peer-to-Peer.

SimGrid is a feature rich framework, with many options and
possibilities. Hopefully its documentation will help you getting at
full gear. But nothing's perfect, and this documentation is really no
exception here. Please help us improving it by reporting the issues
that you see.

SimGrid is a Free Software distributed under the LGPL licence. It
means that you are welcome to use it as you wish, or even to modify
and distribute your version (as long as your version is as free as
ours). It also means that SimGrid is developed by a vivid community of
users and developers. We hope that you will join the community!

SimGrid beneficied of many fundings from various research instances,
including: the ANR, Inria, CNRS, University of Lorraine, University of
Hawai'i at Manoa, ENS Rennes and many others. Thanks to our generous
donators! SimGrid would not exist without the research that they funded.

@section starting_components Typical Study based on SimGrid

Any SimGrid study entails the following components:

 - The studied **Application**. This can be either a distributed
   algorithm described in our simple APIs, or a full featured real
   parallel application using the MPI interface (or other).

 - The **Virtual Platform**. This is a description of a given
   distributed system (machines, links, disks, clusters, etc). Most of
   the platform files are written in XML althrough a Lua interface is
   under development.  SimGrid makes it easy to augment the Virtual
   Platform with a Dynamic Scenario where for example the links are
   slowed down (because of external usage), the machines fail. You
   have even support to specify the applicative workload that you want
   to feed to your application.

 - The application's **Deployment Description**. In SimGrid terminology,
   the application is an inert set of source files and binaries. To
   make it run, you have to describe how your application should be
   deployed on the virtual platform. Specify which process is located
   on which host, along with its parameters.

 - The **Platform Models**. They describe how the virtual platform
   reacts to the actions of the application. For example, they compute
   the time taken by a given communication on the virtual platform.
   These models are already included in SimGrid, and you only need to
   pick one and maybe tweak its configuration to get your results.

These components are put together to run a **simulation**, that is an
experiment or a probe. The result of one or many simulation provides
an **outcome** (logs, visualization, statistical analysis) that help
answering the **question** targeted by this study.

The questions that SimGrid can solve include the following:

 - **Compare an Application to another**. This is the classical use
   case for scientists, who use SimGrid to test how the solution that
   they contribute compares to the existing solutions from the
   literature.

 - **Design the best Virtual Platform for a given Application.**
   Tweaking the platform file is much easier than building a new real
   platform for testing purpose. SimGrid also allows co-design of the
   platform and the application by modifying both of them.

 - **Debug Real Applications**. With real platforms, is sometimes
   difficult to reproduce the exact run leading to the bug that you
   are tracking. SimGrid gives you experimental reproducibility,
   clairevoyance (you can explore every part of the system in no
   [simulated] time without modifying it). It makes it very easy to
   mock some parts of the real system that are not under study.

@section starting_gears SimGrid Execution Gears

Depending on the intended study, SimGrid can be run in several gears,
that are different execution modes.

** **Simulation Gear**. This is the most common gear, where you want
to study how your application behaves on the virtual platform under
the experimental scenario.
  
In this gear, SimGrid can provide information about the time taken by
your application, the amount of energy dissipated by the platform to
run your application and the detailed usage of each resource.
   
** **Model-Checking Gear**. This can be seen as a sort of exhaustive
testing gear, where every possible outcome of your application is
explored. In some sense, this gear tests your application for all
possible platforms that you could imagine (and more).
  
You just provide the application and its deployment (amount of
processes and parameters), and the model-checker will literally
explore all possible outcomes by testing all possible message
interleaving: if at some point a given process can either receive the
message A first or the message B depending on the platform
characteristics, the model-checker will explore the scenario where A
arrives first, and then rewind to the same point to explore the
scenarion where B arrives first.

This is a very powerful gear, where you can evaluate the correction of
your application. It can verify either *safety properties* (asserts) 
or *liveless properties* stating for example that if a given event
occures, then another given event will occur in a finite amount of
steps. This gear is not only usable with the abstract algorithms
developed on top of the SimGrid APIs, but also with real MPI
applications (to some extend).

The main limit of Model Checking lays in the huge amount of scenarios
to explore. SimGrid tries to explore only non-redundent scenarios
thanks to classical reduction techniques (such as DPOR and statefull
exploration) but the exploration may well never finish if you don't
carefully adapt your application to this gear.

Another limit of this gear is that it does not use the performance
models of the simulation gear. Time becomes discrete: You can say for
example that the application took 42 steps to run, but there is no way
to know the amount of seconds that it took or the amount of watts that
it dissipated.

** **Benchmark Recording Gear**. During debug sessions, continuous
integration testing and other similar use cases, you are often only
interested in the control flow. If your application apply filters to
huge images split in small blocks, the filtered image is probably not
what you are interested in. You are probably looking for a way to run
each computation kernel only once, save on disk the time it takes and
some other metadata. This code block can then be skipped in simulation
and replaced by a synthetic block using the cached information. The
virtual platform will take this block into account without requesting
the real hosting machine to benchmark it.

@section starting_successes SimGrid Success Stories

TBD

@section starting_limits SimGrid Limits

This framework is by no means the perfect holly grail able to solve
every problem on earth. 

** **SimGrid scope is limited to distributed systems.** Real-time
multithreaded systems are not in the scope. You could probably tweak
SimGrid for such studies (or the framework could possibily be extended
in this direction), but another framework specifically targeting this
usecase would probably be more suited.

** **There is no perfect model, only models adapted to your study.**
The SimGrid models target fast, large studies yet requesting a
realistic results. In particular, our models abstract away parameters
and phenomenon that are often irrelevant to the realism in our
context. 

SimGrid is simply not intended to any study that would mandate the
abstracted phenomenon. Here are some **studies that you should not do
with SimGrid**:

 - Studying the effect of L3 vs L2 cache effects on your application
 - Comparing variantes of TCP
 - Exploring pathological cases where TCP breaks down, resulting in
   abnormal executions.
 - Studying security aspects of your application, in presence of
   malicious agents.

@section starting_next Where to proceed next?

Now that you know about the basic concepts of SimGrid, you can give it
a try. If it's not done yet, first @ref install "install it". Then,
proceed to the section on @ref app "describing the application" that
you want to study.
