/** @addtogroup SMPI_API

This programming environment enables the study of MPI application by
emulating them on top of the SimGrid simulator. This is particularly
interesting to study existing MPI applications within the comfort of
the simulator. The motivation for this work is detailed in the
reference article (available at http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00527150).

Our goal is to enable the study of *unmodified* MPI applications,
although we are not quite there yet (see @ref SMPI_what). In
addition, you can modify your code to speed up your studies or
otherwise increase their scalability (see @ref SMPI_adapting).

\section SMPI_who Who should use SMPI (and who shouldn't)

SMPI is now considered as stable and you can use it in production. You
may probably want to read the scientific publications that detail the
models used and their limits, but this should not be absolutely
necessary. If you already fluently write and use MPI applications,
SMPI should sound very familiar to you. Use smpicc instead of mpicc,
and smpirun instead of mpirun (see below for more details).

Of course, if you don't know what MPI is, the documentation of SMPI
will seem a bit terse to you. You should pick up a good MPI tutorial
on the Internet (or a course in your favorite university) and come
back to SMPI once you know a bit more about MPI. Alternatively, you
may want to turn to the other SimGrid interfaces such as the 
\ref MSG_API environment, or the \ref SD_API one.

\section SMPI_what What can run within SMPI?

You can run unmodified MPI applications (both C and Fortran) within
SMPI, provided that (1) you only use MPI calls that we implemented in
MPI and (2) you don't use any globals in your application.

\subsection SMPI_what_coverage MPI coverage of SMPI

Our coverage of the interface is very decent, but still incomplete;
Given the size of the MPI standard, it may well be that we never
implement absolutely all existing primitives. One sided communications
and I/O primitives are not targeted for now. Our current state is
still very decent: we pass most of the MPICH coverage tests.

The full list of not yet implemented functions is documented in the
file <tt>include/smpi/smpi.h</tt> of the archive, between two lines
containing the <tt>FIXME</tt> marker. If you really need a missing
feature, please get in touch with us: we can guide you though the
SimGrid code to help you implementing it, and we'd glad to integrate
it in the main project afterward if you contribute them back.

\subsection SMPI_what_globals Issues with the globals

Concerning the globals, the problem comes from the fact that usually,
MPI processes run as real UNIX processes while they are all folded
into threads of a unique system process in SMPI. Global variables are
usually private to each MPI process while they become shared between
the processes in SMPI. This point is rather problematic, and currently
forces to modify your application to privatize the global variables.

We tried several techniques to work this around. We used to have a
script that privatized automatically the globals through static
analysis of the source code, but it was not robust enough to be used
in production. This issue, as well as several potential solutions, is
discussed in this article: "Automatic Handling of Global Variables for
Multi-threaded MPI Programs",
available at http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/newPapers/11-23/paper.pdf
(note that this article does not deal with SMPI but with a concurrent
solution called AMPI that suffers of the same issue). 

Currently, we have no solution to offer you, because all proposed solutions will
modify the performance of your application (in the computational
sections). Sacrificing realism for usability is not very satisfying, so we did
not implement them yet. You will thus have to modify your application if it uses
global variables. We are working on another solution, leveraging distributed
simulation to keep each MPI process within a separate system process, but this
is far from being ready at the moment.

\section SMPI_compiling Compiling your code

This is very simply done with the <tt>smpicc</tt> script. If you
already compiled any MPI code before, you already know how to use it.
If not, you should try to get your MPI code running on top of MPI
before giving SMPI a spin. Actually, that's very simple even if it's
the first time you use MPI code: just use smpicc as a compiler (in
replacement of gcc or your usual compiler), and you're set.

\section SMPI_executing Executing your code on top of the simulator

This is done though the <tt>smpirun</tt> script as follows.
<tt>my_hostfile.txt</tt> is a classical MPI hostfile (that is, this
file lists the machines on which the processes must be dispatched, one
per line)  <tt>my_platform.xml</tt> is a classical SimGrid platform
file. Of course, the hosts of the hostfile must exist in the provided
platform. <tt>./program</tt> is the MPI program that you want to
simulate (must be compiled by <tt>smpicc</tt>) while <tt>-arg</tt> is
a command-line parameter passed to this program.

\verbatim
smpirun -hostfile my_hostfile.txt -platform my_platform.xml ./program -arg
\endverbatim

smpirun accepts other parameters, such as <tt>-np</tt> if you don't
want to use all the hosts defined in the hostfile, <tt>-map</tt> to
display on which host each rank gets mapped of <tt>-trace</tt> to
activate the tracing during the simulation. You can get the full list
by running
\verbatim
smpirun -help
\endverbatim

\section SMPI_adapting Adapting your MPI code to the use of SMPI

As detailed in the reference article (available at
http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00527150), you may want to adapt your code
to improve the simulation performance. But these tricks may seriously
hinder the result quality (or even prevent the app to run) if used
wrongly. We assume that if you want to simulate an HPC application,
you know what you are doing. Don't prove us wrong!

\section SMPI_adapting_size Reducing your memory footprint

If you get short on memory (the whole app is executed on a single node when
simulated), you should have a look at the SMPI_SHARED_MALLOC and
SMPI_SHARED_FREE macros. It allows to share memory areas between processes: The
purpose of these macro is that the same line malloc on each process will point
to the exact same memory area. So if you have a malloc of 2M and you have 16
processes, this macro will change your memory consumption from 2M*16 to 2M
only. Only one block for all processes.

If your program is ok with a block containing garbage value because all
processes write and read to the same place without any kind of coordination,
then this macro can dramatically shrink your memory consumption. For example,
that will be very beneficial to a matrix multiplication code, as all blocks will
be stored on the same area. Of course, the resulting computations will useless,
but you can still study the application behavior this way. 

Naturally, this won't work if your code is data-dependent. For example, a Jacobi
iterative computation depends on the result computed by the code to detect
convergence conditions, so turning them into garbage by sharing the same memory
area between processes does not seem very wise. You cannot use the
SMPI_SHARED_MALLOC macro in this case, sorry.

This feature is demoed by the example file
<tt>examples/smpi/NAS/DT-folding/dt.c</tt>

\section SMPI_adapting_speed Toward faster simulations

If your application is too slow, try using SMPI_SAMPLE_LOCAL,
SMPI_SAMPLE_GLOBAL and friends to indicate which computation loops can
be sampled. Some of the loop iterations will be executed to measure
their duration, and this duration will be used for the subsequent
iterations. These samples are done per processor with
SMPI_SAMPLE_LOCAL, and shared between all processors with
SMPI_SAMPLE_GLOBAL. Of course, none of this will work if the execution
time of your loop iteration are not stable.

This feature is demoed by the example file 
<tt>examples/smpi/NAS/EP-sampling/ep.c</tt>


\section SMPI_collective_algorithms Simulating collective operations

MPI collective operations can be implemented very differently from one library 
to another. Actually, all existing libraries implement several algorithms 
for each collective operation, and by default select at runtime which one 
should be used for the current operation, depending on the sizes sent, the number
 of nodes, the communicator, or the communication library being used. These 
decisions are based on empirical results and theoretical complexity estimation, 
but they can sometimes be suboptimal. Manual selection is possible in these cases, 
to allow the user to tune the library and use the better collective if the 
default one is not good enough.

SMPI tries to apply the same logic, regrouping algorithms from OpenMPI, MPICH 
libraries, and from StarMPI (<a href="http://star-mpi.sourceforge.net/">STAR-MPI</a>).
This collection of more than a hundred algorithms allows a simple and effective
 comparison of their behavior and performance, making SMPI a tool of choice for the
development of such algorithms.

\subsection Tracing_internals Tracing of internal communications

For each collective, default tracing only outputs only global data. 
Internal communication operations are not traced to avoid outputting too much data
to the trace. To debug and compare algorithm, this can be changed with the item 
\b tracing/smpi/internals , which has 0 for default value.
Here are examples of two alltoall collective algorithms runs on 16 nodes, 
the first one with a ring algorithm, the second with a pairwise one :

<br/>
\endhtmlonly

\subsection Selectors

The default selection logic implemented by default in OpenMPI (version 1.7) 
and MPICH (version 3.0.4) has been replicated and can be used by setting the
\b smpi/coll_selector item to either ompi or mpich. The code and details for each 
selector can be found in the <tt>src/smpi/colls/smpi_(openmpi/mpich)_selector.c</tt> file.
As this is still in development, we do not insure that all algorithms are correctly
 replicated and that they will behave exactly as the real ones. If you notice a difference,
please contact <a href="http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/simgrid-devel">SimGrid developers mailing list</a>

The default selector uses the legacy algorithms used in versions of SimGrid
 previous to the 3.10. they should not be used to perform performance study and 
may be removed in the future, a different selector being used by default.

\subsection algos Available algorithms

For each one of the listed algorithms, several versions are available,
 either coming from STAR-MPI, MPICH or OpenMPI implementations. Details can be
 found in the code or in <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~dkl/research/papers/ics06.pdf">STAR-MPI</a> for STAR-MPI algorithms.

Each collective can be selected using the corresponding configuration item. For example, to use the pairwise alltoall algorithm, one should add \b --cfg=smpi/alltoall:pair to the line. This will override the selector (for this algorithm only) if provided, allowing better flexibility.

Warning: Some collective may require specific conditions to be executed correctly (for instance having a communicator with a power of two number of nodes only), which are currently not enforced by Simgrid. Some crashes can be expected while trying these algorithms with unusual sizes/parameters

\subsection auto Automatic evaluation 

(Warning : This is experimental and may be removed or crash easily)

An automatic version is available for each collective (or even as a selector). This specific 
version will loop over all other implemented algorithm for this particular collective, and apply 
them while benchmarking the time taken for each process. It will then output the quickest for 
each process, and the global quickest. This is still unstable, and a few algorithms which need 
specific number of nodes may crash.


\subsection add Add an algorithm

To add a new algorithm, one should check in the src/smpi/colls folder how other algorithms 
are coded. Using plain MPI code inside Simgrid can't be done, so algorithms have to be 
changed to use smpi version of the calls instead (MPI_Send will become smpi_mpi_send). Some functions may have different signatures than their MPI counterpart, please check the other algorithms or contact us using <a href="http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/simgrid-devel">SimGrid developers mailing list</a>.

Example: adding a "pair" version of the Alltoall collective.

 - Implement it in a file called alltoall-pair.c in the src/smpi/colls folder. This file should include colls_private.h.

 - The name of the new algorithm function should be smpi_coll_tuned_alltoall_pair, with the same signature as MPI_Alltoall.

 - Once the adaptation to SMPI code is done, add a reference to the file ("src/smpi/colls/alltoall-pair.c") in the SMPI_SRC part of the DefinePackages.cmake file inside buildtools/cmake, to allow the file to be built and distributed.

 - To register the new version of the algorithm, simply add a line to the corresponding macro in src/smpi/colls/cools.h ( add a "COLL_APPLY(action, COLL_ALLTOALL_SIG, pair)" to the COLL_ALLTOALLS macro ). The algorithm should now be compiled and be selected when using --cfg=smpi/alltoall:pair at runtime.

 - To add a test for the algorithm inside Simgrid's test suite, juste add the new algorithm name in the ALLTOALL_COLL list found inside buildtools/cmake/AddTests.cmake . When running ctest, a test for the new algorithm should be generated and executed. If it does not pass, please check your code or contact us.

 - Feel free to push this new algorithm to the SMPI repository using Git.
