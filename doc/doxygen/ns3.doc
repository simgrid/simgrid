/*! \page pls_ns3 ns-3 as a SimGrid model

\tableofcontents

You can use the well-known 
<a href="http://www.nsnam.org/"><b>ns-3</b></a> packet-level network
simulator as a SimGrid model, for example to investigate the validity
of your simulation. Just install ns-3 and recompile SimGrid accordingly.

\section pls_ns3_install Installing ns-3

The easiest is to install it with the package manager. Under Debian/Ubuntu, simply type as root:

\verbatim
apt-get install libns3-dev ns3
\endverbatim

You can also install it from scratch with the following commands:

\verbatim
# Download the source
wget http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.26.tar.bz2
tar -xf ns-allinone-3.26.tar.bz2
cd ns-allinone-3.26/ns-3.26/
# Configure, build and install
./waf configure --prefix="/opt/ns3" # or give another path if you prefer
./waf
./waf install
\endverbatim

For more information, please refer to the ns-3 documentation
<a href="http://www.nsnam.org/">(official website)</a>.

\section pls_ns3_config Enabling SimGrid's support for ns-3

Normally, you just have to enable ns-3 in ccmake or cmake as
follows. If you installed ns-3 in a regular path, just drop the
NS3_HINT configuration item.

\verbatim
cmake . -Denable_ns3=ON -DNS3_HINT=/opt/ns3 # or change the path if needed
\endverbatim

By the end of the configuration, cmake reports whether ns-3 was found,
and this information is also available in <tt>include/simgrid_config.h</tt>
If your local copy defines the variable \c SIMGRID_HAVE_NS3 to 1, then ns-3
was correctly detected. If it's defined to 0, then something went
wrong. Explore <tt>CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log</tt> and
<tt>CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log</tt> to diagnose the problem.

Afterward, you can test your installation as follows:

\verbatim
$ ctest -R ns3
\endverbatim

\section pls_ns3_use Using ns-3 from SimGrid

The SimGrid-ns3 binding only contains features that are common to both
systems: ns-3 wireless models are not available, while SimGrid routes
cannot be longer than 1. Also, the platform built in ns-3 from the
SimGrid description is very basic.

Any route longer than one will be ignored when using ns-3. They are
harmless, but you still need to connect your hosts using one-hop routes.
The best solution is to add routers to split your route. Here is an
example of invalid platform:

@code{.xml}
<platform>
  <host id="alice" speed="1Gf" />
  <host id="bob"   speed="1Gf" />
  
  <link id="l1" bw="1Mbps" />
  <link id="l2" bw="1Mbps" />

  <route src="alice" dst="bob">
    <link_ctn id="l1"/> <!-- INVALID WITH NS-3 -->
    <link_ctn id="l2"/> <!-- length=2 IS TOO MUCH -->
  </route>
</platform>
@endcode
  
Here is the same platform expressed in a way that ns-3 will understand.
There is no direct connexion from alice to bob, but that's OK because
ns-3 will find the path from point to point.

@code{.xml}
<platform>
  <host id="alice" speed="1Gf" />
  <host id="bob"   speed="1Gf" />

  <router id="r1" /> <!-- routers are compute-less hosts -->

  <link id="l1" bw="1Mbps" />
  <link id="l2" bw="1Mbps" />

  <route src="alice" dst="r1">
    <link_ctn id="l1"/> 
  </route>
  
  <route src="r1" dst="bob">
    <link_ctn id="l2"/> 
  </route>
</platform>
@endcode


Once your platform is OK, just change the "network/model"
configuration option to "NS3" as follows. The rest remains unchanged.

\verbatim
./network-ns3 ../../platforms/small_platform_one_link_routes.xml 3hosts_2links_d.xml --cfg=network/model:NS3
\endverbatim

Many other files from the examples/platform directory are usable with
the ns-3 model, such as @ref examples/platforms/dogbone.xml. Check the file
examples/msg/network-ns3/network-ns3.tesh to see which ones are used
in our regression tests. You may also be interested in the
@ref msg_ex_ns3 "ns-3/SimGrid examples".

@subsection pls_ns3_shortcomings Shortcomings of the ns-3 bindings in SimGrid

A ns-3 platform is automatically created from the provided SimGrid
platform. However, there are some known caveats:

<ul>

  <li>The default values (e.g., TCP parameters) are the ns3 default
      values.</li>

  <li>ns-3 networks are routed using the shortest path algorithm, using
      ns3::Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables.</li>

  <li>End hosts cannot have more than one interface card. So, your
      SimGrid hosts should be connected to the platform through only
      one link. Otherwise, your SimGrid host will be considered as a
      router.</li>

</ul>

Our goal is to keep the ns-3 plugin of SimGrid as easy (and hopefully
readable) as possible. If the current state does not fit your needs,
you should modify this plugin, and/or create your own plugin from the
existing one.

@section pls_trouble Troubleshooting with ns-3 and SimGrid

@subsection pls_ns3_config_trouble I fail to compile ns-3 within SimGrid

If you have a ns-3 version that is not known to SimGrid yet, edit \c
tools/cmake/Modules/FindNS3.cmake in your SimGrid tree, according to
the comments on top of this file.

If the compilation fails on Debian/Ubuntu when linking the library
because of some .a file that cannot be used dynamically, then you are
probably using a very old (and buggy) <tt>libns3-dev</tt>
package. Update it, or install <tt>libns3-3</tt> manually.

@subsection pls_trouble_hang The simulation hangs at some point

If your simulation hangs in a communication, this is probably because
one host is sending data that is not routable in your platform. Make
sure that you only use routes of length 1, and that any host is
connected to the platform.

Arguably, SimGrid could detect this situation and report it, but
unfortunately, this is still to be done.

@subsection pls_trouble_warning I get a warning that some routes are ignored

Please read again the @ref pls_ns3_use section.
