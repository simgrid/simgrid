/**
@defgroup s4u_api  S4U: Next Generation SimGrid API
@brief Future core API, mixing the full power of SimGrid to the power of C++. 

The S4U API is currently under heavy work, but will eventually
deprecate the MSG and SimDag APIs. Everything that you can do in
SimGrid will be possible in S4U. 

@warning <b>S4U is not ready for public use yet</b>. You should not go
	 that path unless you know what you are doing.  If unsure,
	 proceed to @ref MSG_API instead.

Unsurprisingly, the S4U interface matches the concepts presented in 
@ref starting_components "the introduction". You should read this page
first, to not get lost in the amount of classes provided here.

@section s4u_raii Memory Management of S4U objects

For sake of simplicity, we use
[RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization)
everywhere in S4U. This is an idiom where resources are automatically
managed through the context. Provided that you never manipulate
objects of type Foo directly but always FooPtr references, you will
never have to explicitely release the resource that you use nor to
free the memory of unused objects.

Here is a little example:

@code{cpp}
void myFunc() 
{
  simgrid::s4u::MutexPtr mutex = simgrid::s4u::Mutex::createMutex(); // Too bad we cannot use `new` here

  mutex->lock();   // use the mutex as a simple reference
  //  bla bla
  mutex->unlock(); 
  
} // The mutex will get automatically freed because the only existing reference gets out of scope
@endcode
*/
