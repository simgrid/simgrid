/*! \page pls Packet level simulation

It is possible to use a packet-level network simulator
instead of the default flow-based simulation. You may want to use such
an approach if you have doubts about the validity of the default model
or if you want to perform some validation experiments. At the moment,
we support the GTNetS simulator and since version 3.6.2, ns-3.


\section pls_simgrid_configuration_gtnets Using GTNetS


<i>
To enable GTNetS model inside SimGrid it is needed to patch the GTNetS simulator source code
and build/install it from scratch
</i>

 - <b>Download and enter the recent downloaded GTNetS directory</b>

\verbatim
svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/simgrid/contrib/trunk/GTNetS/
cd GTNetS
\endverbatim


 - <b>Use the following commands to unzip and patch GTNetS package to work within SimGrid.</b>

\verbatim
unzip gtnets-current.zip
tar zxvf gtnets-current-patch.tgz
cd gtnets-current
cat ../00*.patch | patch -p1
\endverbatim

  - <b>OPTIONALLY</b> you can use a patch for itanium 64bit processor family.

\verbatim
cat ../AMD64-FATAL-Removed-DUL_SIZE_DIFF-Added-fPIC-compillin.patch | patch -p1
\endverbatim

 - <b>Compile GTNetS</b>

   Due to portability issues it is possible that GTNetS does not compile in your architecture. The patches furnished in SimGrid SVN repository are intended for use in Linux architecture only. Unfortunately, we do not have the time, the money, neither the manpower to guarantee GTNetS portability. We advice you to use one of GTNetS communication channel to get more help in compiling GTNetS.


\verbatim
ln -sf Makefile.linux Makefile
sed -i 's/-fPIC/-fPIC -fpermissive/g' Makefile
make depend
make debug
\endverbatim


 - <b>NOTE</b> A lot of warnings are expected but the application should compile
 just fine. If the makefile insists in compiling some QT libraries
 please try a make clean before asking for help.


 - <b>To compile optimized version</b>

\verbatim
make opt
\endverbatim


 - <b>Installing GTNetS</b>

 It is important to put the full path of your libgtsim-xxxx.so file when creating the symbolic link. Replace < userhome > by some path you have write access to.

\verbatim
ln -sf /<absolute_path>/gtnets_current/libgtsim-debug.so /<userhome>/usr/lib/libgtnets.so
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}/<userhome>/usr/lib/
mkdir /<userhome>/usr/include/gtnets
cp -fr SRC/*.h /<userhome>/usr/include/gtnets
\endverbatim


 - <b>Enable GTNetS support in SimGrid</b>

In order to enable gtnets with simgrid you have to give where is gtnets. (path to \<gtnets_path\>/lib and \<gtnets_path\>/include)

\verbatim
cmake . -Denable_gtnets=ON -Dgtnets_path=/<userhome>/usr
\endverbatim

 - <b>Once you have followed all the instructions for compiling and
   installing successfully you can activate this feature at
   runntime with the following options:</b>

\verbatim
cd simgrid
make
ctest -R gtnets
\endverbatim


 - <b>Or try the GTNetS model dogbone example with</b>

\verbatim
gtnets/gtnets gtnets/onelink-p.xml gtnets/onelink-d.xml --cfg=network_model:GTNets
\endverbatim

 - <b>DISCLAIMER</b>
 The patches provided by us worked successfully with GTNetS found
 <a href="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/MANIACS/GTNetS/software/gtnets-current.zip">here</a>,
 dated from 12th June 2008. Due to the discontinuing development of
 GTNetS it is impossible to precise a version number. We STRONGLY recommend you
 to download and install the GTNetS version found in SimGrid repository as explained above.

\section pls_simgrid_configuration_ns3 Using NS3

It is possible to use discrete-event network simulator <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/">(ns-3)</a> for Internet systems
instead of the default one.

A ns-3 platform is created according to the platform file you provide in SimGrid format. However from this configuration, we had to set up some extra parameters :

<ul>
<li>
First, whenever possible, we let default ns3 values and we don't changed it ; in case you have doubts on values for those parameters (TCP parameters for example), blame ns-3...
</li>

<li>
Second, routing used inside ns-3 is a global and static one, relying on a shortest path algorithm. We did so by using ns3::Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables.
</li>

<li>
Third, we also choose to restrict the way your platform is built : end hosts cannot have more than one interface card (so, only one &lt;link&gt; in your SimGrid platform should link
an end host to the platform ; if not, your end host will be considered as a router.
</li>

</ul>
<i>
To use ns3 model inside SimGrid you have to install at least the version 3.10 of ns3 simulator.
</i>

- <b>Download and enter the lateast release (here the 3.12.1)</b>

\verbatim
http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.12.1.tar.bz2
tar -xf ns-allinone-3.12.1.tar.bz2
cd ns-allinone-3.12.1/ns-3.12.1/
\endverbatim

- <b>Configure, make and install ns3</b>

\verbatim
./waf configure --prefix="ns-3_install_directory"
./waf
./waf install
\endverbatim

After install ns-3 you should have directories into your "ns-3_install_directory":
	\li include/ns3/
	\li lib/
	\li bin/ (with 3.12)

You also need to add to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH : "ns-3_install_directory/lib".

- <b>Enable ns-3 support on SimGrid</b>

In order to enable ns-3 with simgrid you have to give where is ns-3 to the simgrid configuration command. (path to \<ns3_path\>/lib and \<ns3_path\>/include)

\verbatim
cmake . -Denable_ns3=ON -Dns3_path=<ns3_path>
\endverbatim

With the output of the configuration you can see if ns-3 is detected by included the directory to flags.

\verbatim

Now you can compile SimGrid
\verbatim

Then you can see if ns-3 is well activated by testing
\verbatim
ctest -R ns3
\endverbatim

You should see
