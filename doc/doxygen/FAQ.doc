@tableofcontents

This document is the FAQ of the MSG interface. Some entries are a bit aging and it should be refreshed at some point.

@section faq_simgrid I'm new to SimGrid. I have some questions. Where should I start?

You are at the right place... To understand what you can do or
cannot do with SimGrid, you should read the
<a href="https://simgrid.org/tutorials.html">tutorial
slides</a> from the SimGrid's website. You may find more up-to-date
material on the
<a href="http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/blog/SimGrid/">blog of
Martin Quinson</a>.

Another great source of inspiration can be found in the @ref s4u_examples.

If you are stuck at any point and if this FAQ cannot help you, please drop us a
mail to the user mailing list: <simgrid-user@lists.gforge.inria.fr>.

@subsection faq_visualization Visualizing and analyzing the results

It is sometime convenient to "see" how the agents are behaving. If you
like colors, you can use <tt>tools/MSG_visualization/colorize.pl </tt>
as a filter to your MSG outputs. It works directly with INFO. Beware,
INFO() prints on stderr. Do not forget to redirect if you want to
filter (e.g. with bash):
@verbatim
./msg_test small_platform.xml small_deployment.xml 2>&1 | ../../tools/MSG_visualization/colorize.pl
@endverbatim

We also have a more graphical output. Have a look at section @ref options_tracing.

@section faq_howto Feature related questions

@subsection faq_MIA "Could you please add (your favorite feature here) to SimGrid?"

Here is the deal. The whole SimGrid project (MSG, SURF, ...) is
meant to be kept as simple and generic as possible. We cannot add
functions for everybody's needs when these functions can easily be
built from the ones already in the API. Most of the time, it is
possible and when it was not possible we always have upgraded the API
accordingly. When somebody asks us a question like "How to do that?
Is there a function in the API to simply do this?", we're always glad
to answer and help. However if we don't need this code for our own
need, there is no chance we're going to write it... it's your job! :)
The counterpart to our answers is that once you come up with a neat
implementation of this feature (task duplication, RPC, thread
synchronization, ...), you should send it to us and we will be glad to
add it to the distribution. Thus, other people will take advantage of
it (and we don't have to answer this question again and again ;).

You'll find in this section a few "Missing In Action" features. Many
people have asked about it and we have given hints on how to simply do
it with MSG. Feel free to contribute...

@subsection faq_MIA_MSG MSG features

@subsubsection faq_MIA_thread_synchronization How to synchronize my user processes?

It depends on why you want to synchronize them.  If you just want to
have a shared state between your processes, then you probably don't
need to do anything. User processes never get forcefully interrupted
in SimGrid (unless you explicitly request the parallel execution of
user processes -- see @ref options_virt_parallel).

Even if several processes are executed at the exact same time within
the simulation, they are linearized in reality by default: one process
always run in an exclusive manner, atomic, uninterrupted until it does
a simcall (until it ask a service from the simulation kernel). This is
surprising at first, but things are much easier this way, both for the
user (who don't have to protect her shared data) and for the kernel
(that avoid many synchronization issues too). Processes are executed
concurrently in the simulated realm, but you don't need to bother with
this in the real realm.

If you really need to synchronize your processes (because it's what
you are studying or to create an atomic section that spans over
several simcalls), you obviously cannot use regular synchronization
mechanisms (pthread_mutexes in C or the synchronized keyword in Java).
This is because the SimGrid kernel locks all processes and unlock them
one after the other when they are supposed to run, until they give the
control back in their simcall. If one of them gets locked by the OS
before returning the control to the kernel, that's definitively a
deadlock.

Instead, you should use the synchronization mechanism provided by the
simulation kernel. This could with a SimGrid mutex, a SimGrid
condition variables or a SimGrid semaphore, as described in @ref
msg_synchro (in Java, only semaphores are available). But actually,
many synchronization patterns can be encoded with communication on
mailboxes. Typically, if you need one process to notify another one,
you could use a condition variable or a semaphore, but sending a
message to a specific mailbox does the trick in most cases.

@subsubsection faq_MIA_communication_time How can I get the *real* communication time?

Communications are synchronous and thus if you simply get the time
before and after a communication, you'll only get the transmission
time and the time spent to really communicate (it will also take into
account the time spent waiting for the other party to be
ready). However, getting the *real* communication time is not really
hard either. The following solution is a good starting point.

@code
int sender()
{
  m_task_t task = MSG_task_create("Task", task_comp_size, task_comm_size,
                                  calloc(1,sizeof(double)));
  *((double*) task->data) = MSG_get_clock();
  MSG_task_put(task, workers[i % workers_count], PORT_22);
  XBT_INFO("Send completed");
  return 0;
}
int receiver()
{
  m_task_t task = NULL;
  double time1,time2;

  time1 = MSG_get_clock();
  a = MSG_task_get(&(task), PORT_22);
  time2 = MSG_get_clock();
  if(time1<*((double *)task->data))
     time1 = *((double *) task->data);
  XBT_INFO("Communication time :  \"%f\" ", time2-time1);
  free(task->data);
  MSG_task_destroy(task);
  return 0;
}
@endcode

@subsection faq_MIA_SimDag SimDag related questions

@subsubsection faq_SG_comm Implementing communication delays between tasks.

A classic question of SimDag newcomers is about how to express a
communication delay between tasks. The thing is that in SimDag, both
computation and communication are seen as tasks.  So, if you want to
model a data dependency between two DAG tasks t1 and t2, you have to
create 3 SD_tasks: t1, t2 and c and add dependencies in the following
way:

@code
SD_task_dependency_add(t1, c);
SD_task_dependency_add(c, t2);
@endcode

This way task t2 cannot start before the termination of communication c
which in turn cannot start before t1 ends.

When creating task c, you have to associate an amount of data (in bytes)
corresponding to what has to be sent by t1 to t2.

Finally to schedule the communication task c, you have to build a list
comprising the workstations on which t1 and t2 are scheduled (w1 and w2
for example) and build a communication matrix that should look like
[0;amount ; 0; 0].

@subsubsection faq_SG_DAG How to implement a distributed dynamic scheduler of DAGs.

Distributed is somehow "contagious". If you start making distributed
decisions, there is no way to handle DAGs directly anymore (unless I
am missing something). You have to encode your DAGs in term of
communicating process to make the whole scheduling process
distributed. Here is an example of how you could do that. Assume T1
has to be done before T2.

@code
 int your_agent(int argc, char *argv[] {
   ...
   T1 = MSG_task_create(...);
   T2 = MSG_task_create(...);
   ...
   while(1) {
     ...
     if(cond) MSG_task_execute(T1);
     ...
     if((MSG_task_get_remaining_computation(T1)=0.0) && (you_re_in_a_good_mood))
        MSG_task_execute(T2)
     else {
        /* do something else */
     }
   }
 }
@endcode

If you decide that the distributed part is not that much important and that
DAG is really the level of abstraction you want to work with, then you should
give a try to @ref SD_API.

@subsection faq_MIA_generic Generic features

@subsubsection faq_MIA_batch_scheduler Is there a native support for batch schedulers in SimGrid?

No, there is no native support for batch schedulers and none is
planned because this is a very specific need (and doing it in a
generic way is thus very hard). However some people have implemented
their own batch schedulers. Vincent Garonne wrote one during his PhD
and put his code in the contrib directory of our SVN so that other can
keep working on it. You may find inspiring ideas in it.

@subsection faq_platform Platform building and Dynamic resources

@subsubsection faq_platform_synthetic Generating synthetic but realistic platforms

Another possibility to get a platform file is to generate synthetic
platforms. Getting a realistic result is not a trivial task, and
moreover, nobody is really able to define what "realistic" means when
speaking of topology files. You can find some more thoughts on this
topic in these
<a href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~alegrand/articles/Simgrid-Introduction.pdf">slides</a>.

If you are looking for an actual tool, there we have a little tool to
annotate Tiers-generated topologies. This perl-script is in
<tt>tools/platform_generation/</tt> directory of the SVN. Dinda et Al.
released a very comparable tool, and called it GridG.


The specified computing power will be available to up to 6 sequential
tasks without sharing. If more tasks are placed on this host, the
resource will be shared accordingly. For example, if you schedule 12
tasks on the host, each will get half of the computing power. Please
note that although sound, this model were never scientifically
assessed. Please keep this fact in mind when using it.

@section faq_troubleshooting Troubleshooting

@subsection faq_surf_network_latency I get weird timings when I play with the latencies.

OK, first of all, remember that units should be Bytes, Flops and
Seconds. If you don't use such units, some SimGrid constants (e.g. the
SG_TCP_CTE_GAMMA constant used in most network models) won't have the
right unit and you'll end up with weird results.

Here is what happens with a single transfer of size L on a link
(bw,lat) when nothing else happens.

@verbatim
0-----lat--------------------------------------------------t
|-----|**** real_bw =min(bw,SG_TCP_CTE_GAMMA/(2*lat)) *****|
@endverbatim

In more complex situations, this min is the solution of a complex
max-min linear system.  Have a look
<a href="http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/simgrid-devel/2006-April/thread.html">here</a>
and read the two threads "Bug in SURF?" and "Surf bug not
fixed?". You'll have a few other examples of such computations. You
can also read "A Network Model for Simulation of Grid Application" by
Henri Casanova and Loris Marchal to have all the details. The fact
that the real_bw is smaller than bw is easy to understand. The fact
that real_bw is smaller than SG_TCP_CTE_GAMMA/(2*lat) is due to the
window-based congestion mechanism of TCP. With TCP, you can't exploit
your huge network capacity if you don't have a good round-trip-time
because of the acks...

Anyway, what you get is t=lat + L/min(bw,SG_TCP_CTE_GAMMA/(2*lat)).

  * if I you set (bw,lat)=(100 000 000, 0.00001), you get t =  1.00001 (you fully
use your link)
  * if I you set (bw,lat)=(100 000 000, 0.0001),  you get t =  1.0001 (you're on the
limit)
  * if I you set (bw,lat)=(100 000 000, 0.001),   you get t = 10.001  (ouch!)

This bound on the effective bandwidth of a flow is not the only thing
that may make your result be unexpected. For example, two flows
competing on a saturated link receive an amount of bandwidth inversely
proportional to their round trip time.
