@page outcomes_logs Simulation Logging
@brief Log4J-like logging system.

Using @c printf or @c println to display information is possible, but
quickly unpractical, as the logs of all processes get intermixed in
your program's output. As an answer, the SimGrid logging module allow
you to sort and filter the logs by emitter, by module and by gravity
level. 

The SimGrid logging module is highly <b>configurable</b>: as in Log4J,
the user can choose <i>at runtime</i> what messages to show and what
to hide, as well as how messages get displayed. It is also <b>easy to
use</b>, both to the programmer (using preprocessor macros black
magic) and to the user (with command line options). And finally, its
<b>performance</b> is highly optimized.

@tableofcontents

@section log_overview Main Concepts

There is three main concepts in SimGrid's logging mechanism:
** **category**, **priority** and **appender**. These three concepts work
together to enable developers to log messages according to message
type and priority, and to control at runtime how these messages are
formatted and where they are reported.

@subsection log_cat Logging categories

In SimGrid, the logs are sorted by topics (called categories) so that
the user can chose which topics to display and hide at runtime. These
categories are organized as a hierarchy, following the architecture of
modules in the simulator.

The full list of all categories that exist in the SimGrid base library 
@ref XBT_log_cats "is available in the documentation".
You can also provide ```--help-logs``` on the command line of any
SimGrid simulator to see the list of all existing categories that it
contains.

@subsection log_pri Logging priorities

The user can also specify the desired level of details for each category. This is
controlled by the <i>priority</i> concept (which should maybe be renamed to
<i>severity</i>). For example, you may want to see every debugging message
of MSG while only being interested into the messages at level "error" or
higher about the XBT internals.

@subsection log_app Message appenders

The message appenders are in charge of actually displaying the
message to the user. For now, four appenders exist: 
- the default one prints stuff on stderr 
- file sends the data to a single file
- rollfile overwrites the file when the file grows too large
- splitfile creates new files with a specific maximum size

@subsection log_lay Message layouts

The message layouts are the elements in charge of choosing how each message
will look like. Their result is a string which is then passed to the appender
attached to the category to be displayed.

For now, there is two layouts: The simple one, which is good for most cases,
and another one allowing users to specify the format they want.
@ref log_use_conf provides more info on this.

@subsection log_hist History of this module

Historically, this module is an adaptation of the log4c project, which is dead
upstream, and which I was given the permission to fork under the LGPL licence
by the log4c's authors. The log4c project itself was loosely based on the
Apache project's Log4J, which also inspired Log4CC, Log4py and so on. Our work
differs somehow from these projects anyway, because the C programming language
is not object oriented.

@section log_API C Programmer interface

Please also refer to the @ref XBT_log "full API" for more information.

@subsection log_API_cat Constructing the category hierarchy

Every category is declared by providing a name and an optional
parent. If no parent is explicitly named, the root category, LOG_ROOT_CAT is
the category's parent.

A category is created by a macro call at the top level of a file.  A
category can be created with any one of the following macros:

 - @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_CATEGORY(MyCat,desc); Create a new root
 - @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_SUBCATEGORY(MyCat, ParentCat,desc);
    Create a new category being child of the category ParentCat
 - @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_CATEGORY(MyCat,desc);
    Like XBT_LOG_NEW_CATEGORY, but the new category is the default one
      in this file
 -  @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_SUBCATEGORY(MyCat, ParentCat,desc);
    Like XBT_LOG_NEW_SUBCATEGORY, but the new category is the default one
      in this file

The parent cat can be defined in the same file or in another file (in
which case you want to use the @ref XBT_LOG_EXTERNAL_CATEGORY macro to make
it visible in the current file), but each category may have only one
definition. Likewise, you can use a category defined in another file as 
default one using @ref XBT_LOG_EXTERNAL_DEFAULT_CATEGORY

Typically, there will be a Category for each module and sub-module, so you
can independently control logging for each module.

For a list of all existing categories, please refer to the @ref XBT_log_cats
section. This file is generated automatically from the SimGrid source code, so
it should be complete and accurate. 
Also refer to the @ref XBT_log "full API" for more information. 

@subsection log_API_pri Declaring message priority

A category may be assigned a threshold priority. The set of priorities are
defined by the @ref e_xbt_log_priority_t enum. All logging request under
this priority will be discarded.

If a given category is not assigned a threshold priority, then it inherits
one from its closest ancestor with an assigned threshold. To ensure that all
categories can eventually inherit a threshold, the root category always has
an assigned threshold priority.

Logging requests are made by invoking a logging macro on a category.  All of
the macros have a printf-style format string followed by arguments. If you
compile with the -Wall option, gcc will warn you for unmatched arguments, ie
when you pass a pointer to a string where an integer was specified by the
format. This is usually a good idea.

Here is an example of the most basic type of macro. This is a logging
request with priority <i>warning</i>.

<code>XBT_CLOG(MyCat, xbt_log_priority_warning, "Values are: %d and '%s'", 5,
"oops");</code>

A logging request is said to be enabled if its priority is higher than or
equal to the threshold priority of its category. Otherwise, the request is
said to be disabled. A category without an assigned priority will inherit
one from the hierarchy.

It is possible to use any non-negative integer as a priority. If, as in the
example, one of the standard priorities is used, then there is a convenience
macro that is typically used instead. For example, the above example is
equivalent to the shorter:

<code>XBT_CWARN(MyCat, "Values are: %d and '%s'", 5, "oops");</code>

@subsection log_API_isenabled Checking if a particular category/priority is enabled

It is sometimes useful to check whether a particular category is
enabled at a particular priority. One example is when you want to do
some extra computation to prepare a nice debugging message. There is
no use of doing so if the message won't be used afterward because
debugging is turned off.

Doing so is extremely easy, thanks to the XBT_LOG_ISENABLED(category, priority).

@subsection log_API_subcat Using a default category (the easy interface)

If @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_SUBCATEGORY(MyCat, Parent) or
@ref XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_CATEGORY(MyCat) is used to create the
category, then the even shorter form can be used:

<code>XBT_WARN("Values are: %s and '%d'", 5, "oops");</code>

Only one default category can be created per file, though multiple
non-defaults can be created and used.

@subsection log_API_easy Putting all together: the easy interface

First of all, each module should register its own category into the categories
tree using @ref XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_SUBCATEGORY.

Then, logging should be done with the #XBT_DEBUG, #XBT_VERB, #XBT_INFO,
#XBT_WARN, #XBT_ERROR and #XBT_CRITICAL macros.

Under GCC, these macro check there arguments the same way than printf does. So,
if you compile with -Wall, the following code will issue a warning:
<code>XBT_DEBUG("Found %s (id %d)", some_string, a_double)</code>

If you want to specify the category to log onto (for example because you
have more than one category per file, add a C before the name of the log
producing macro (ie, use #XBT_CDEBUG, #XBT_CVERB, #XBT_CINFO, #XBT_CWARN,
#XBT_CERROR and #XBT_CCRITICAL and friends), and pass the category name as
first argument.

The TRACE priority is not used the same way than the other. You should use
the #XBT_IN, #XBT_OUT and #XBT_HERE macros instead.

@subsection log_API_example Example of use

Here is a more complete example:

@verbatim
#include "xbt/log.h"

/ * create a category and a default subcategory * /
XBT_LOG_NEW_CATEGORY(VSS);
XBT_LOG_NEW_DEFAULT_SUBCATEGORY(SA, VSS);

int main() {
       / * Now set the parent's priority.  (the string would typically be a runtime option) * /
       xbt_log_control_set("SA.thresh:3");

       / * This request is enabled, because WARNING >= INFO. * /
       XBT_CWARN(VSS, "Low fuel level.");

       / * This request is disabled, because DEBUG < INFO. * /
       XBT_CDEBUG(VSS, "Starting search for nearest gas station.");

       / * The default category SA inherits its priority from VSS. Thus,
          the following request is enabled because INFO >= INFO.  * /
       XBT_INFO("Located nearest gas station.");

       / * This request is disabled, because DEBUG < INFO. * /
       XBT_DEBUG("Exiting gas station search");
}
@endverbatim

Please also refer to the @ref XBT_log "full API" for more information.

@section log_user User interface

@subsection log_use_conf Configuration

Although rarely done, it is possible to configure the logs during
program initialization by invoking the xbt_log_control_set() method
manually. A more conventional way is to use the --log command line
argument. xbt_init() (called by MSG_init() and friends)
checks and deals properly with such arguments.

@subsubsection log_use_conf_thres Threshold configuration

The most common setting is to control which logging event will get
displayed by setting a threshold to each category through the
<tt>threshold</tt> keyword.

For example, @verbatim --log=root.threshold:debug@endverbatim will make
SimGrid <b>extremely</b> verbose while @verbatim
--log=root.thres:critical@endverbatim should shut it almost
completely off.

Note that the <tt>threshold</tt> keyword can be abbreviated here. For example,
all the following notations have the same result.
@verbatim
--log=root.threshold:debug
--log=root.threshol:debug
--log=root.thresho:debug
--log=root.thresh:debug
--log=root.thres:debug
--log=root.thre:debug
--log=root.thr:debug
--log=root.th:debug
--log=root.t:debug
--log=root.:debug     <--- That's obviously really ugly, but it actually works.
@endverbatim

The full list of recognized thresholds is the following:

 - trace: enter and return of some functions
 - debug: crufty output
 - verbose: verbose output for the user wanting more
 - info: output about the regular functionning
 - warning: minor issue encountered
 - error: issue encountered
 - critical: major issue encountered 

@subsubsection log_use_conf_multi Passing several settings

You can provide several of those arguments to change the setting of several
categories, they will be applied from left to right. So,
@verbatim --log="root.thres:debug root.thres:critical"@endverbatim should
disable almost any logging.

Note that the quotes on above line are mandatory because there is a space in
the argument, so we are protecting ourselves from the shell, not from SimGrid.
We could also reach the same effect with this:
@verbatim --log=root.thres:debug --log=root.thres:critical@endverbatim

@subsubsection log_use_conf_fmt Format configuration

You can control the format of log messages through the <tt>fmt</tt>
keyword. For example, @verbatim --log=root.fmt:%m@endverbatim reduces
the output to the user-message only, removing any decoration such as
the date, or the process ID, everything.

Here are the existing format directives:

 - %%: the % char
 - %%n: platform-dependent line separator (LOG4J compatible)
 - %%e: plain old space (SimGrid extension)

 - %%m: user-provided message

 - %%c: Category name (LOG4J compatible)
 - %%p: Priority name (LOG4J compatible)

 - %%h: Hostname (SimGrid extension)
 - %%P: Process name (SimGrid extension -- note that with SMPI this is the integer value of the process rank)
 - %%t: Thread "name" (LOG4J compatible -- actually the address of the thread in memory)
 - %%i: Process PID (SimGrid extension -- this is a 'i' as in 'i'dea)

 - %%F: file name where the log event was raised (LOG4J compatible)
 - %%l: location where the log event was raised (LOG4J compatible, like '%%F:%%L' -- this is a l as in 'l'etter)
 - %%L: line number where the log event was raised (LOG4J compatible)
 - %%M: function name (LOG4J compatible -- called method name here of course).

 - %%d: date (UNIX-like epoch)
 - %%r: application age (time elapsed since the beginning of the application)


If you want to mimic the simple layout with the format one, you would use this
format: '[%%h:%%i:(%%i) %%r] %%l: [%%c/%%p] %%m%%n'. This is not completely correct
because the simple layout do not display the message location for messages at
priority INFO (thus, the fmt is '[%%h:%%i:(%%i) %%r] [%%c/%%p] %%m%%n' in this
case). Moreover, if there is no process name (ie, messages coming from the
library itself, or test programs doing strange things) do not display the
process identity (thus, fmt is '[%%r] %%l: [%%c/%%p] %%m%%n' in that case, and '[%%r]
[%%c/%%p] %%m%%n' if they are at priority INFO).

For now, there is only two format modifiers: the precision and the
width fields. You can for example specify %.4r to get the application
age with 4 numbers after the radix, or %15p to get the process name
on 15 columns. Finally, you can specify %10.6r to get the time on at
most 10 columns, with 6 numbers after the radix. 

Note that when specifying the width, it is filled with spaces. That
is to say that for example %5r in your format is converted to "% 5f"
for printf (note the extra space); there is no way to fill the empty
columns with 0 (ie, pass "%05f" to printf). Another limitation is
that you cannot set specific layouts to the several priorities.

@subsubsection log_use_conf_app Category appender

You can control the appender of log messages through the <tt>app</tt>
keyword. For example, 
@verbatim --log=root.app:file:mylogfile@endverbatim redirects the
output to the file mylogfile.

For splitfile appender, the format is 
@verbatim --log=root.app:splitfile:size:mylogfile_%.format@endverbatim

The size is in bytes, and the % wildcard will be replaced by the number of the
file. If no % is present, it will be appended at the end.

rollfile appender is also available, it can be used as
@verbatim --log=root.app:rollfile:size:mylogfile@endverbatim
When the file grows to be larger than the size, it will be emptied and new log 
events will be sent at its beginning 

Any appender setup this way have its own layout format (simple one by default),
so you may have to change it too afterward. Moreover, the additivity of the log category
is also set to false to prevent log event displayed by this appender to "leak" to any other
appender higher in the hierarchy. If it is not what you wanted, you can naturally change it
manually.

@subsubsection log_use_conf_add Category additivity

The <tt>add</tt> keyword allows one to specify the additivity of a
category (see @ref log_in_app). '0', '1', 'no', 'yes', 'on'
and 'off' are all valid values, with 'yes' as default.

The following example resets the additivity of the xbt category to true (which is its default value).
@verbatim --log=xbt.add:yes@endverbatim

@subsection log_use_misc Misc and Caveats

  - Do not use any of the macros that start with '_'.
  - Log4J has a 'rolling file appender' which you can select with a run-time
    option and specify the max file size. This would be a nice default for
    non-kernel applications.
  - Careful, category names are global variables.
  - When writing a log format, you often want to use spaces. If you don't
    protect these spaces, they are used as configuration elements separators.
    For example, if you want to remove the date from the logs, you want to pass the following 
    argument on the command line. The outer quotes are here to protect the string from the shell 
    interpretation while the inner ones are there to prevent simgrid from splitting the string 
    in several log parameters (that would be invalid).
    @verbatim --log="'root.fmt:%l: [%p/%c]: %m%n'"@endverbatim
    Another option is to use the SimGrid-specific format directive \%e for
    spaces, like in the following.
    @verbatim --log="root.fmt:%l:%e[%p/%c]:%e%m%n"@endverbatim

@section log_internals Internal considerations

This module is loaded of macro black magic, and when it goes wrong,
SimGrid studently loose its ability to explain its problems. When
messing around this module, I often find useful to define
XBT_LOG_MAYDAY (which turns it back to good old printf) for the time
of finding what's going wrong. But things are quite verbose when
everything is enabled...

@subsection log_in_perf Performance

Except for the first invocation of a given category, a disabled logging request
requires an a single comparison of a static variable to a constant.

There is also compile time constant, @ref XBT_LOG_STATIC_THRESHOLD, which
causes all logging requests with a lower priority to be optimized to 0 cost
by the compiler. By setting it to xbt_log_priority_infinite, all logging
requests are statically disabled at compile time and cost nothing. Released executables
<i>might</i>  be compiled with (note that it will prevent users to debug their problems)
@verbatim-DXBT_LOG_STATIC_THRESHOLD=xbt_log_priority_infinite@endverbatim

Compiling with the @verbatim-DNLOG@endverbatim option disables all logging
requests at compilation time while the @verbatim-DNDEBUG@endverbatim disables
the requests of priority below INFO.

@todo Logging performance *may* be improved further by improving the message
propagation from appender to appender in the category tree.

@subsection log_in_app Appenders

Each category has an optional appender. An appender is a pointer to a
structure which starts with a pointer to a do_append() function. do_append()
prints a message to a log.

When a category is passed a message by one of the logging macros, the category performs the following actions:

  - if the category has an appender, the message is passed to the
    appender's do_append() function,
  - if additivity is true for the category, the message is passed to
    the category's parent. Additivity is true by default, and can be
    controlled by xbt_log_additivity_set() or something like --log=root.add:1 (see @ref log_use_conf_add).
    Also, when you add an appender to a category, its additivity is automatically turned to off.
    Turn it back on afterward if it is not what you wanted.

By default, only the root category have an appender, and any other category has
its additivity set to true. This causes all messages to be logged by the root
category's appender.

The default appender function currently prints to stderr.
