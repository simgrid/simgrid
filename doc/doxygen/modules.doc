/** 
@defgroup MSG_API      MSG
@brief Simple programming environment

MSG was the first distributed programming environment provided within
SimGrid. While almost realistic, it remains quite simple
(simplistic?).

@section MSG_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)

You should use this module if you want to study some heuristics for a
given problem you don't really want to implement. If you want to use
DAGs, have a look at the \ref SD_API programming environment. If you
want to study an existing MPI program, have a look at the \ref
SMPI_API one. If none of those programming environments fits your
needs, you may consider implementing your own directly on top of 
\ref SURF_API (but you probably want to contact us before).

/**
@defgroup TRACE_API TRACE
@brief Tracing mechanism and its functions.

SimGrid can trace the resource (of hosts and links) utilization using
any of its programming interfaces (MSG, SimDAG and SMPI). This means
that the tracing will register how much power is used for each host
and how much bandwidth is used for each link of the platform.

The idea of the tracing facilities is to give SimGrid users to
possibility to classify MSG and SimDAG tasks by category, tracing the
platform utilization (hosts and links) for each of the categories.
The API enables the declaration of categories and a function to
associate them to the tasks (MSG and SD). The tasks that are not
classified according to a category are not traced. If no categories
are specified, simulations can still be traced using a special
parameter in the command line (see \ref tracing for details).

/** \defgroup SD_API      SimDag
    \brief Programming environment for DAG applications

    SimDag provides some functionnalities to simulate parallel task scheduling
    with DAGs models (Direct Acyclic Graphs).
    The old versions of SimGrid were based on DAGs. But the DAG part (named SG)
    was removed in SimGrid 3 because the new kernel (\ref SURF_API) was implemented. \ref SURF_API
    was much faster and more flexible than SG and did not use DAGs.
    SimDag is a new implementation of DAGs handling and it is built on top of \ref SURF_API.

    \section SD_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)

    You should use this programming environment of the SimGrid suite if you want
    to study algorithms and heuristics with DAGs of parallel tasks.
    If you don't need to use DAGs for your simulation, have a look at the
    \ref MSG_API programming environment.
    If you want to study an existing MPI program, have a look at the
    \ref SMPI_API one.
    If none of those programming environments fits your needs, you may
    consider implementing your own directly on top of \ref SURF_API (but you
    probably want to contact us before).

/**
@defgroup SURF_API SURF
@brief Internal kernel of all the simulators used in SimGrid, and associated models.

SURF provides the core functionnalities to simulate a virtual
platform. It is very low-level and is not intended to be used by end
users, but rather to serve as a basis for higher-level simulators. Its
interface are not frozen (and will probably never be), and the
structure emphasis on performance over ease of use. This module
contains the platform models. If you need a model that is not encoded
yet, please come to the devel mailing list so that we can discuss on
the feasibility of your idea.

Please note that as it is not really intended for public use, this
module is only partially documented.
