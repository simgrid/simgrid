This is the end of the first big part of this tutorial. At this point, you
know pretty much everything about message passing in GRAS. In second big
part, you will learn how to describe data to the middleware in order to
convey your own structures in messages instead of the predefined scalar
types. But for now, it is time to recap what we have seen so far.

\section GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_intro Message passing compared to procedure call

In GRAS, you pass message to get remote component to achieve some work for
you. In some sense, this is very similar to the good old procedure 
abstraction: you call some procedure to get <i>it</i> doing some work for
you. Looking closer at this good old abstraction, we notice 4 call semantics:

 - <tt>void procedure(void)</tt> this is a procedure accepting no argument
   and returning no result (<b>type 1</b>).   
 - <tt>void procedure2(int i)</tt> this is a procedure accepting an
   argument, but returning no result (<b>type 2</b>).  
 - <tt>int function(void)</tt> this is a function accepting no argument, but
   returning a result (<b>type 3</b>).   
 - <tt>int function(int i)</tt> this is a function accepting an argument,
   and returning a result (<b>type 4</b>).

The whole story of the GRAS message passing subsystem is to allow to
reproduce these call semantics in a distributed setting. That being said, We
must also note that some messages exchanged using GRAS do not intend to
mimic these semantics, but instead to help the syncronisation between
distributed processes. When exchanged from peer A to peer B, they don't mean
that A requests a service from B, but rather that A gives an information (a
signal) to B. It could be for example that A reached a specific point of its
computation, and that B can proceed with its own (this syncronisation schema
being a simple rendez-vous). These messages are covered in the next part of
this recapping (\ref GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_sync).

To return on the call semantics described above, there is a big difference
between the types T1 and T2 on one side and the types T3 and T4 on the other
side. In the second case, the caller do wait for an answer from the callee
side. In a distributed setting, you have to exchange one extra message in
that case. That is why T1;T2 (sometimes refered as <i>one-way messages</i>)
are treated quite differently in GRAS from T3;T4.

\section GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc Remote Procedure Call in GRAS

Mimicing the same call semantic in a distributed setting is the goal of the
RPC systems. To do so in GRAS, you must do the following actions:

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc1 1. Declaring a datatype

If you want that your messages convey complex datatypes and not only scalar,
you have to do it first. Learning how to do so is the subject of the second
part of this tutorial. For now, simply observe that this is the same thing
than doing a <tt>typedef</tt> in your code before using this type:
\verbatim typedef struct {
  int a;
  char b;
} *mytype;\endverbatim

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc2 2. Declaring a message type

This is very similar to forward procedure declarations in your sequential
code:
\verbatim int myfunction(mytype myarg);\endverbatim
More formally it comes down to associating a data type to a given
symbol name. For example, in \ref GRAS_tut_tour_simpledata, we specified
that the message <tt>"kill"</tt> conveyed a double as payload.

Doing so depends on whether you have a one-way message (ie, type 1 or 2) or
not. One-way messages are declared with gras_msgtype_declare() while RPC
messages are declared with gras_msgtype_declare_rpc()

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc3 3. Declaring message callbacks

If the message is intended to be a work request one (and not a
syncronization one as detailed below), you then want to attach some code to
execute when a process receives the given request. In other words, you want
to attach a callback to the message. Of course, you usualy don't want to do
so on every nodes, but only on "servers" or "workers" or such. First of all,
you need to declare the callback itself. This function that will be executed
on request incoming must follow a very specific prototype (the same
regardless of the call semantic): 

\verbatim
int callback_name(gras_msg_cb_ctx_t context, void *payload) \endverbatim

The first argument (of type #gras_msg_cb_ctx_t) is an opaque structure
describing the callback context: who sent you the message (which you can
find back using gras_msg_cb_ctx_from()), whether it's a one-way call or not,
and so on. GRAS functions altering the call (such as gras_msg_rpcreturn(),
used to return the result to the caller) require this context as argument.

The second argument is a pointer to where the message payload is stored. In
the T1 and T3 semantics (ie, when the message had no payload), this second
argument is NULL. If not, the first line of your callback will probably
retrieve the payload and store it in a variable of yours. The semantic for
this is very systematic, if not elegant: If your payload is of type TOTO,
<tt>payload</tt> is a pointer to a TOTO variable. So, cast it properly (add
<tt>(TOTO*)</tt> in front of it), and dereference it (add a star right
before the cast). For example:

\verbatim
TOTO myvariable = *(TOTO*) payload; \endverbatim

This becomes even uglier if the conveyed type is a pointer itself, but you
must stick to the rule anyway:

\verbatim
int **myvariable = *(int ** *) payload; \endverbatim

If your message is of semantic T3 or T4 (ie, it returns a value to the
caller), then you must use the function gras_msg_rpcreturn() to do so. It
takes three arguments: 
  - a timeout to use (so that the server don't get frozen if the client is
    unresponsive)
  - the message context (the variable ctx of type #gras_msg_cb_ctx_t you got
    as argument of the callback)
  - a pointer to the data to send back.
After it returned the result this way, you should free any data you
mallocated in your callback (including the data you returned to the caller:
GRAS made a copy of it during the call to gras_msg_rpcreturn()).

The callback is expected to return 0 if ok, as detailed in 
\ref GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc_aside1.

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc4 4. Attaching callbacks to the messages

To attach a given callback to a given message, you simply use
gras_cb_register(). If you even want to de-register a callback, use
gras_cb_unregister().

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc5 5. Send your message from the client

Again, sending messages depend on the semantic call. If you have a one-way
message, you should call gras_msg_send() while RPC calls are sent with
gras_msg_rpccall(). The main difference between them is that you have an
extra argument for RPC, to specify where to store the result.

It is also possible to call RPC asyncronously: you send the request (using
gras_msg_rpc_async_call()), do some other computation. And then later, you
wait for the answer of your RPC (using gras_msg_rpc_async_wait()).

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc_aside1 Aside: stacking callbacks

The callback is expected to return 0 if everything went well, which is the
same semantic than the "main()" function. You can also build stacks of
callbacks. It is perfectly valid to register several callbacks to a given
message. When a message arrives, it is passed to the firstly-registered
callback. If the callback returns 0, it means that it consumed the message,
which is discarded. If the callback returns 1 (or any other "true" value),
the message is passed to the next callback of the stack, and so on. At the
end, if no callback returned 0, an exception is raised.

This mecanism can for example be used to introduce dupplication and replay.
You add a callback simply in charge of storing the message in a database,
and since it returns 1, the message is then passed to the "real" callback.
To be perfectly honest, I never had use of this functionnality myself, but I
feel it could be useful in some cases...

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc_aside2 Aside: Exceptions and callbacks

One of the parts I'm the most proud of in GRAS is this one: imagine you have
a rpc callback executing on a remote server. If this callback raises an
exception, it will be propagated on the network back to the client, and
revived there. So, the client will get automatically any exception raised by
the server. Cool, isn't it? Afterward, simply refer to the <tt>host</tt>
field of the #xbt_ex_t to retrieve the machine on which it was initialy
raised.

In case you wonder about the exceptions I'm speaking about (after all,
SimGrid is in C ANSI, and there is usually no exception mecanism in C ANSI),
you may want to refer to the section \ref XBT_ex. Note that exception can be
troublesome to use (mainly because the compiler won't catch your mistakes on
this).

\subsection GRAS_tut_tour_message_recaping_rpc_aside3 Aside: Symbol versionning (TODO)

This section covers a point not explicited elsewhere in the documentation.
It may be seen as a bit hardcore, and you should probably skip it the first
time you read the tutorial.
