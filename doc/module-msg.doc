    \subsection MSG_ext_icomms_Sender Sender function

    The sender send to a receiver an asynchronous message with the function "MSG_task_isend()". Cause this function is non-blocking 
    we have to make "MSG_comm_test()" to know   if the communication is finished for finally destroy it with function "MSG_comm_destroy()".
    It also available to "make MSG_comm_wait()" which make both of them.  

      C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
       - the number of tasks to distribute
       - the computation size of each task
       - the size of the files associated to each task
       - a list of host that will accept those tasks.
       - the time to sleep at the beginning of the function
       - This time defined the process sleep time
			if time = 0 use of MSG_comm_wait()
			if time > 0 use of MSG_comm_test()


    \until Receiver function

    \subsection MSG_ext_icomms_Receiver Receiver function

    This function executes tasks when it receives them. As the receiving is asynchronous we have to test the communication to know
    if it is completed or not with "MSG_comm_test()" or wait for the completion "MSG_comm_wait()".

      C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
       - the id to use for received the communication.
