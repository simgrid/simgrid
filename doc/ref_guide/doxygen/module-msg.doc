/** \addtogroup MSG_API

      MSG was the first distributed programming environment provided within
      SimGrid. While almost realistic, it remains quite simple (simplistic?).
      This describes the native to MSG.

      \section jMSG_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)

      You should use MSG if you want to study some heuristics for a
      given problem you don't really want to implement. If you want to
      use the C programming language, your are in the right
      section. To use the Java or Ruby programming interfaces, please refer to
      the documentation provided in the relevant packages.

/**
@defgroup msg_simulation   Main MSG simulation Functions
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief Describes how to setup and control your simulation.

The basic workflow is the following (check the \ref MSG_examples for
details).

 -# Initialize the library with #MSG_init
 -# Create a platform (usually by parsing a file with
    #MSG_create_environment)
 -# Register the functions that your processes are supposed to run with
    #MSG_function_register (and maybe #MSG_function_register_default)
 -# Launch your processes from a deployment file with #MSG_launch_application
 -# Run the simulation with #MSG_main
 -# Cleanup the library with #MSG_clean before ending your program
    (optional).

/**
@defgroup msg_trace_driven Trace-driven simulations
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief This section describes the functions allowing to build trace-driven simulations.

\htmlonly <!-- DOXYGEN_NAVBAR_LABEL="Trace-Driven" --> \endhtmlonly

This is very handy when you want to test an algorithm or protocol that
does nothing unless it receives some events from outside. For example,
a P2P protocol reacts to requests from the user, but does nothing if
there is no such event.

In such situations, SimGrid allows to write your protocol in your C
file, and the events to react to in a separate text file. Declare a
function handling each of the events that you want to accept in your
trace files, register them using #xbt_replay_action_register in your main,
and then use #MSG_action_trace_run to launch the simulation. You can
either have one trace file containing all your events, or a file per
simulated process.

Check the examples in <b>examples/msg/actions/actions.c</b> for details.

/**
@defgroup MSG_LUA      Lua bindings
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief Lua bindings to MSG (\ref MSG_API)

@htmlonly <!--  DOXYGEN_NAVBAR_LABEL="LUA bindings" --> @endhtmlonly

This is the lua bindings of the \ref MSG_API interface.

\section lMSG_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)

If you want to use MSG to study your algorithm, but you don't want to
use the C language (using \ref MSG_API), then you should use some
bindings such as this one. The advantage of the lua bindings is that
they are distributed directly with the main archive (in contrary to
Java and Ruby bindings, for example, that are distributed separately).
Another advantage of lua is that there is almost no performance loss
with regard to the C version (at least there shouln't be any -- it is
still to be precisely assessed).

\section MSG_Lua_funct  Lua offered functionnalities in MSG

Almost all important features of the MSG interface are available from
the lua bindings. Unfortunately, since doxygen does not support the
lua modules implemented directly in C as we are using, there is no
ready to use reference documentation for this module. Even more than
for the other modules, you will have to dig into the source code of
the examples to learn how to use it.

\section Lua_examples Examples of lua MSG

  - \ref MSG_ex_master_slave_lua
  - \ref MSG_ex_master_slave_lua_bypass
  - Also, the lua version of the Chord example (in the source tree)
    is a working non-trivial example of use of the lua bindings

/**
@defgroup msg_deprecated_functions MSG Deprecated
@ingroup MSG_API
@brief This section describes the deprecated functions. PLEASE STOP USING THEM.

We don't remove them because the ability to run old scientific
code is something important to us. But these functionalities are
not actively supported anymore.

To access these functions, you should define the relevant option
at configuration time in ccmake.
