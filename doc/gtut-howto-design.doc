/** @defgroup GRAS_howto_design HOWTO design a GRAS application
    @ingroup GRAS_howto HOWTOs 

This page tries to give some hints on how to design a GRAS application. The
provided model and functionnalities are somehow different from the other
existing solutions (nammly, MPI), and this page tries to give you the feeling
of the GRAS philosophy. You may also want to (re)read the \ref GRAS_tut_intro.

As an example, you may have a look at \ref GRAS_tut_tour_explicitwait_use,
which somehow follows the guidelines given here.

\section GRAS_howto_design_what What is a GRAS application

As explained in \ref GRAS_tut_intro, you should see a GRAS application as a
distributed service. There is two main parts: 
 - a user API, composed of regular functions offering services to the users
 - a set of nodes (or processes, or agents, name them as you want)
   collaborating and exchanging messages to achieve the requested service on
   behalf of the user.

It is naturally possible to not follow this split, and let the users of your
service directly sending messages by themselves. Nevertheless, this
encapsulation is a good thing because distributed computing is a bit hard to
achieve. You may thus not want to force your users to go into this tricky
part. Instead, shield them with a regular C API.

If you are the only user of the code you develop, I'd advice you to still
follow this approach. But do as you prefer, of course.

\section GRAS_howto_design_design The design phase

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_design_api Specify the user API

These will be the entry points of your system, and you should think twice
about their syntax and semantic.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_design_processes Identify the types of processes in your application

Note that we are not speaking about the amount of processes in your
application, but rather on the type of processes. The amount of distinct
roles. 

Depending on your application, there may be only one type (for example in a
peer-to-peer system), two types of processes (for example in a client/server
system), three types of processes (for example if you add a forwarder to a
client/server system), or maybe much more.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_design_protocol Design an application-level protocol

During this phase, you should try to sketch your application before
implementing it.  You should sketch temporal execution of the application. I
personnaly prefer to do so graphically on a blackboard, drawing comic strips
of the several steps of the algorithm under specific conditions. Ask
yourself questions as "What gets exchanged between who when the user request
this?", "How to react when this condition occures?" and "What is the initial
state of the system?"

Here are some important points to identify in your future application during
the design phase:

\subsubsection GRAS_howto_design_design_protocol_msg Message types

The most important point to design a GRAS protocol is to identify the
different type of messages that can be exchanged in your system, and the
datatype of their payload. Doing so, remember that GRAS messages are
strongly typed. They are formed by a so-called message type (identified by
its name) and a type description describing what kind of data you can
include in the message. The message type is a qualitative information
"someone asked you to run that function" while the payload is the
quantitative information (the arguments to the function).
   
A rule of thumb: <b>A given message type have only one semantic meaning, and
one syntaxic payload datatype</b>. If you don't do so, you have a problem.
   
   - If the same message type may have two semantic value depending on some
     fields of the payload, I'd say that you used MPI too much before. You
     should use the full power of the GRAS messaging functions by using
     several message types. It will simplify your code and yield better
     performance.
		     		     
   - You shouldn't have a given message type with differing payload
     datatypes. It is possible to do so (using gras_datadesc_ref_generic()),
     but it's quite painful, and is rarely what you really want. Are you
     sure you don't want to split these messages in two separate types?
       
\subsubsection GRAS_howto_design_design_protocol_cb Message callbacks

Also sketch what your processes should do when they get the given message.
These action will constitute the message callbacks during the
implementation. But you should first go through a design phase of the
application level-protocol, were these action remain simplistic. Also
identify the process-wide globals needed to write the callbacks (even if it
can be later).
     

\section GRAS_howto_design_implem The implementation phase

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_implem_cb Write your callbacks

Most of the time, you will find tons of specific cases you didn't thought
about in the design phase, and going from a code sketch to an actual
implementation is often quite difficult. 

You will probably need some process-wide globals to store some state of your
processes. See \ref GRAS_tut_tour_globals on need.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_implem_api Implement your user-API

If your protocol was wisely designed, writting the user API should be quite
easy.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_implem_init Implement the initialization code

You must write some initialization code for all the process kinds of your
application. 

You may want to turn your code into a clean GRAS library by using the adhoc
mecanism, but unfortunately, it's not documented yet. Worse, there is two
such systems for now, one of them being deprecated. Check the \ref AMOK_pm
implementation to see how to use the new system. Naturally, this is only
optional.

\section GRAS_howto_design_test The test phase

Testing software is important to check that it works. But in a distributed
setting, this is mandatory.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_test_sim Test it on the simulator

In addition to all the good old bugs you find in a classical C program
(memory corruption, logical errors, etc), distributed computing introduce
subtil ways to get things wrong. Actually, this is why I wrote GRAS: to get
able to test my code on simulator before using it in distributed settings.

The simulator is a nicely controled environment. You can rerun the same code
in the exact same condition as often as you want to reproduce a bug. You can
run the simulator in a debugger such as valgrind or gdb to debug all
processes at once. You can cheat and have global variables (to check global
invariants or such). You can test your code on platform you don't have
access to in the real life, or in condition which almost never occur (such
as having 80% of the nodes stopping at the same time).

Use all these possibilities, and test your code throughfully in the
simulator. You may find it boring, but when you'll go to the next steps,
you'll dream of going back into the comfort of the simulator.

\subsection GRAS_howto_design_test_local Test it locally

Once it works in the simulator, test it in real-life, but will all processes
on the same host. Even if the GRAS API is made to make the simulator as
close to the real life as possible, you often discover new and exciting bugs
when going outside of the simulator. Fix'em all before going further.

If you find you've found a discrepency between both implementation of GRAS,
please drop us a mail. That would be a bug.
   
\subsection GRAS_howto_design_test_dist Test it in a distributed setting

You are now ready for the big jump...
