\subsection installSimgrid_intro Some generalitty

\subsubsection installSimgrid_intro1 What is Cmake?

CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. For more information see official web site <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">here</a>.

\subsubsection installSimgrid_intro2 Why cmake?

CMake permits to developers to compil projects on different plateforms. Then many tools are embedded like ctest for making test, a link to cdash for vizualise results but also test coverage and bug reports. 

\subsubsection installSimgrid_intro3 What cmake need?

CMake needs some prerequists like :

For Unix and MacOS:
  \li make
  \li perl and libpcre
  \li c and c++ compiler
  \li ccmake for graphical used of CMake
  \li cmake <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">(download page)</a>

For Windows :
  \li cmake 2.8 <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">(download page)</a>
  \li MinGW <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/">(download page)</a>
  \li perl <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">(download page)</a>
  \li git <a href="http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.7.4-preview20110204.exe">(download page)</a>

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakeoption2 Options explaination

  \li enable_gtnets : set to true implie that user wants to use gtnets.

  \li enable_lua : set to true implie that user wants to add lua langage into simgrid compilation.

  \li enable_compile_optimizations : add flags "-O3 -finline-functions -funroll-loops -fno-strict-aliasing"

  \li CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER : Change the c++ compiler. 
  
  \li pipol_user : specify your pipol username if you want to use the pipol-remote command.

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakeoption3 Initialisation

Those options are initialized the first time you launch "cmake ." whithout specified option.

\verbatim
enable_gtnets			on
enable_lua			on
enable_smpi			on
enable_tracing			on
enable_compile_optimizations	on
enable_debug			on
enable_compile_warnings		off
enable_maintainer_mode		off
enable_coverage 		off
enable_memcheck 		off
enable_model-checking		off
enable_jedule 	 		off
enable_latency_bound_tracking 	off 
enable_lib_static		off
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX		/usr/local
custom_flags			null
gtnets_path			null
pipol_user			null
\endverbatim

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakeoption4 Option's cache and how to reset?

When options have been set they are keep into a cache file named "CMakeCache.txt". So if you want 
reset values you just delete this file located to the project directory.

\subsection installSimgrid_cmakecompilation Cmake compilation

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakecompilation1 With command line.

On Unix or Mac platform:

\verbatim
cmake -D[name]=[value] ... ./
make
\endverbatim

On Windows platform:

\verbatim
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -D[name]=[value] ... ./
mingw32-make
\endverbatim

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakecompilation2 With ccmake tool.

\verbatim
"ccmake ./"
\endverbatim
Then follow instructions.

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakecompilation2bis Build out of source.

As cmake generate many files used for compilation, we recommand to make a build directory.
For examples you can make :

\verbatim
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments$ cd simgrid/"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/simgrid$ mkdir build_directory"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/simgrid$ cd build_directory/"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/simgrid/build_directory$ cmake ../"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/simgrid/build_directory$ make"
\endverbatim

Or complety out of sources :

\verbatim
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments$ mkdir build_dir"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments$ cd build_dir/"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/build_dir$ cmake ../simgrid/"
"navarrop@caraja:~/Developments/build_dir$ make"
\endverbatim

Those two kind of compilation permit to delete files created by compilation easier.

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakecompilation3 Resume of command line

 \li CMake
\verbatim
cmake <path>			configure the project for Unix and Mac
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" <path>	configure the project for Windows
make				build all targets for Unix and Mac
ming32-make				buill all targets for windows
(g)make VERBOSE=1		build all targets and print build command lines
make check			test all targets and summarize
make dist			make the distrib
make distcheck			check the dist (make + make dist + make check) 
(g)make install 		install the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
(g)make uninstall		uninstall the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
(g)make clean			clean all targets
make simgrid_documentation	Create simgrid documentation
\endverbatim

When the project have been succesfully compiling and build you can make tests.

 \li CTest
\verbatim
ctest			launch only tests
ctest -D Continuous
ctest -D Continuous(Start|Update|Configure|Build)
ctest -D Continuous(Test|Coverage|MemCheck|Submit)
ctest -D Experimental
ctest -D Experimental(Start|Update|Configure|Build)
ctest -D Experimental(Test|Coverage|MemCheck|Submit)
ctest -D Nightly				
ctest -D Nightly(Start|Update|Configure|Build)
ctest -D Nightly(Test|Coverage|MemCheck|Submit)
ctest -D NightlyMemoryCheck
\endverbatim

If you want to test before make a commit you can simply make "ctest -D Experimental" and then you can visualize results submitted into Cdash. <a href="http://cdash.inria.fr/CDash/index.php?project=Simgrid">(Go to Cdash site)</a>.

\subsection installSimgrid_cmakeinstall How to install with cmake?

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakeinstall1 From Git. 

\verbatim
git clone git://scm.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid.git simgrid
cd simgrid
cmake -Denable_maintainer_mode=on -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/navarrop/Bureau/install_simgrid ./
make 
make install
\endverbatim

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakeinstall2 From a distrib

\verbatim
wget https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/28674/simgrid-3.6.1.tar.gz
tar xf simgrid-3.6.1.tar.gz
cd simgrid-3.6.1
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/navarrop/Bureau/install_simgrid ./
make
make install
\endverbatim


\subsection installSimgrid_cmakehowto How to modified sources files for developers

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakehowto1 Add an executable or examples.

If you want make an executable you have to create a CMakeList.txt to the src directory. 
You must specified where to create the executable, source list, dependencies and the name of the binary.

\verbatim
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH "./")			
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH "${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/lib")

add_executable(get_sender get_sender.c)					#add_executable(<name_of_target> <src list>)

### Add definitions for compile
target_link_libraries(get_sender simgrid m pthread) 	#target_link_libraries(<name_of_targe> <dependencies>)
\endverbatim

Then you have to modified <project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/MakeExeLib.cmake and add 
this line :
\verbatim
add_subdirectory(${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/<path_where_is_CMakeList.txt>)
\endverbatim

\subsubsection installSimgrid_cmakehowto2 Delete/add sources to lib.

If you want modified, add or delete source files from a library you have to edit <project/directory>/buildtools/Cmake/DefinePackages.cmake

\verbatim
set(JMSG_JAVA_SRC
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/MsgException.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/JniException.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/NativeException.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/HostNotFoundException.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/ProcessNotFoundException.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/Msg.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/Process.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/Host.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/Task.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/MsgNative.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/ApplicationHandler.java
	${CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY}/src/java/simgrid/msg/Sem.java
)
\endverbatim

\section installSimgrid_Win Installing the SimGrid library with Windows pakage

\subsection installSimgrid_Win_install Installing SimGrid

Before start the installation, you need to be sure to have the following dependencies:
  \li cmake 2.8 <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">(download page)</a>
  \li MinGW <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/">(download page)</a>
  \li perl <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">(download page)</a>
  \li git <a href="http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.7.4-preview20110204.exe">(download page)</a>
  
Then download the package <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=12">SimGrid Installer</a>,
execute it and follow instructions.

\htmlonly
<a href="win_install_01.png" border=0><img src="win_install_01.png" border=0></a>
\endhtmlonly

Step 1: Accept the license. 

\htmlonly
<a href="win_install_02.png" border=0><img src="win_install_02.png" border=0></a>
\endhtmlonly

Step 2: Select packets to install.

\htmlonly
<a href="win_install_03.png" border=0><img src="win_install_03.png" border=0></a>
\endhtmlonly

Step 3: Choice where to install packets previously selected. Please don't use spaces in path.
 
\htmlonly
<a href="win_install_04.png" border=0><img src="win_install_04.png" border=0></a>
\endhtmlonly

Step 4: Restart your computer to take in consideration environment variables.

\subsection installSimgrid_Win_compile1 Compile a project "HelloWorld"

In the SimGrid install directroy you should have an HelloWorld project to explain you how to start 
compiling a source file. There are:
\verbatim
- HelloWorld.c		The example source file.
- CMakeLists.txt	It allows to configure the project.
- FindPCRE.cmake	This finds and links to the pcre library (Normally included into Simgrid directory "GnuWin32").
- README 		This explaination.
\endverbatim

Now let's compil this example:
\li Run windows shell "cmd".
\li Open HelloWorld Directory ('cd' command line).
\li Create a build directory and change directory. (optional)
\li Type 'cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" \<path_to_HelloWorld_project\>'
\li Run mingw32-make
\li You should obtain a runnable example ("HelloWorld.exe").

For compiling your own code you can simply copy the HelloWorld project and rename source name. It will
create a target with the same name of the source. 

\subsection installSimgrid_Win_compile2 How to add and compile a new example

\li Put your source file into the helloWord directory.
\li Edit CMakeLists.txt by removing the Find Targets section and add those two lines into this section
\verbatim 
################
# FIND TARGETS #
################
add_executable(TARGET_NAME SOURCES) 		#It creates a target called 'TARGET_NAME.exe' with the sources 'SOURCES'
target_link_libraries(TARGET_NAME simgrid pcre) #Links TARGET_NAME with simgrid and pcre
\endverbatim	
\li To initialize and build your project, you'll need to run
\verbatim
cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" \<path_to_HelloWorld_project\>
\endverbatim
\li Run "mingw32-make"
\li You should obtain "TARGET_NAME.exe".

\section installSimgrid_setting_MSG Setting up your own MSG code

Do not build your simulator by modifying the SimGrid examples.  Go
outside the SimGrid source tree and create your own working directory
(say <tt>/home/joe/SimGrid/MyFirstScheduler/</tt>).

Suppose your simulation has the following structure (remember it is
just an example to illustrate a possible way to compile everything;
feel free to organize it as you want).

      \li <tt>sched.h</tt>: a description of the core of the
          scheduler (i.e. which functions are can be used by the
          agents). For example we could find the following functions
          (master, forwarder, slave).

      \li <tt>sched.c</tt>: a C file including <tt>sched.h</tt> and
          implementing the core of the scheduler. Most of these
          functions use the MSG functions defined in section \ref
          msg_gos_functions.

      \li <tt>masterslave.c</tt>: a C file with the main function, i.e.
          the MSG initialization (MSG_global_init()), the platform
          creation (e.g. with MSG_create_environment()), the
          deployment phase (e.g. with MSG_function_register() and
          MSG_launch_application()) and the call to
          MSG_main()).

To compile such a program, we suggest to use the following
Makefile. It is a generic Makefile that we have used many times with
our students when we teach the C language.

\verbatim
all: masterslave 
masterslave: masterslave.o sched.o

INSTALL_PATH = $$HOME
CC = gcc
PEDANTIC_PARANOID_FREAK =       -O0 -Wshadow -Wcast-align \
				-Waggregate-return -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations \
				-Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations \
				-Wmissing-noreturn -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs \
				-Wpointer-arith -Wwrite-strings -finline-functions
REASONABLY_CAREFUL_DUDE =	-Wall
NO_PRAYER_FOR_THE_WICKED =	-w -O2 
WARNINGS = 			$(REASONABLY_CAREFUL_DUDE)
CFLAGS = -g $(WARNINGS)

INCLUDES = -I$(INSTALL_PATH)/include
DEFS = -L$(INSTALL_PATH)/lib/
LDADD = -lm -lsimgrid 
LIBS = 

%: %.o
	$(CC) $(INCLUDES) $(DEFS) $(CFLAGS) $^ $(LIBS) $(LDADD) -o $@ 

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(INCLUDES) $(DEFS) $(CFLAGS) -c -o $@ $<

clean:
	rm -f $(BIN_FILES) *.o *~
.SUFFIXES:
.PHONY : clean

\endverbatim

The first two lines indicates what should be build when typing make
(<tt>masterslave</tt>) and of which files it is to be made of
(<tt>masterslave.o</tt> and <tt>sched.o</tt>). This makefile assumes
that you have set up correctly your <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> variable
(look, there is a <tt>LDADD = -lm -lsimgrid</tt>). If you prefer using
the static version, remove the <tt>-lsimgrid</tt> and add a
<tt>$(INSTALL_PATH)/lib/libsimgrid.a</tt> on the next line, right
after the <tt>LIBS = </tt>.

More generally, if you have never written a Makefile by yourself, type
in a terminal : <tt>info make</tt> and read the introduction. The
previous example should be enough for a first try but you may want to
perform some more complex compilations...

\section installSimgrid_setting_GRAS Setting up your own GRAS code

If you use the GRAS interface instead of the MSG one, then previous section
is not the better source of information. Instead, you should check the GRAS
tutorial in general, and the \ref GRAS_tut_tour_setup in particular.
