    \brief How to build a new API on top of SURF

    SURF provides the functionnalities to simulate the platform. There are two main datatypes in SURF:
    the actions and the resources. Several types of resources exist:
	- the workstation resource,
	- the network resource,
	- the CPU resource,
	- the timer resource.

    The implentation of these resources depends on the platform model you choose. There are several
    platform models. You can select your model by calling surf_workstation_resource_init_CLM03()
    or surf_workstation_resource_init_KCCFLN05(). See the documentation of these functions to have
    more details about the models. Remember that the model KCCFLN05 is an implementation of both the
    workstation resource and the network.

    Typically, your functions should call the SURF functions provided by the structures
    \a surf_workstation_resource->common_public and \a surf_workstation_resource->extension_public.
    See surf_resource_public and surf_workstation_resource_extension_public to know the available functions.

    To initialize SURF, call surf_init(). Then call surf_timer_resource_init() and
    surf_workstation_resource_init_CLM03() or surf_workstation_resource_init_KCCFLN05()
    to create the platform.

    Then you can access the workstations and the network links with
    the global variables \ref host_lib
    and \ref link_lib. Some functions in \a surf_workstation_resource->extension_public can give
    you some information about:
	- a workstation: get_speed(), get_available_speed();
	- a network link: get_link_name(), get_link_latency(), get_link_bandwith();
	- a route: get_route(), get_route_size().

    During the simulation, call \a surf_workstation_resource->extension_public->execute() to schedule a
    computation task on a workstation, or \a surf_workstation_resource->extension_public->communicate()
    to schedule a communication task between two workstations. You can also create parallel task
    with \a surf_workstation_resource->extension_public->execute_parallel_task(). These functions return
    a new action that represents the task you have just created.

    To execute the actions created with \a execute(), \a communicate() or \a execute_parallel_task(), call
    surf_solve(). The function surf_solve() is where the simulation takes place. It returns the
    time elapsed to execute the actions. You can know what actions have changed their state thanks
    to the states sets. For example, if your want to know what actions are finished,
    extract them from \a surf_workstation_resource->common_public->states.done_action_set.
    Depending on these results, you can schedule other tasks and call surf_solve() again. 

    When the simulation is over, just call surf_exit() to clean the memory.

    Have a look at the implementation of \ref MSG_API "MSG" and \ref SD_API "Simdag" to see how these module
    interact with SURF. But if you want to create a new API on top of SURF,
    we strongly recommand you to contact us before anyway.
