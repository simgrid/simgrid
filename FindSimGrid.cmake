# USERS OF PROGRAMS USING SIMGRID
# -------------------------------
#
# If cmake does not find this file, add its path to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:
#    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/FindSimGrid.cmake:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"  cmake .
#
# If this file does not find SimGrid, define SimGrid_PATH:
#    cmake -DSIMGRID_PATH=/path/to/simgrid .

#
# DEVELOPERS OF PROGRAMS USING SIMGRID
# ------------------------------------
#
#  1. Include this file in your own CMakeLists.txt (before defining any target)
#     Either by copying it in your tree, or (recommended) by using the
#     version automatically installed by SimGrid.
#
#  2. This will define a target called 'SimGrid::Simgrid'. Use it as:
#       target_link_libraries(your-simulator SimGrid::SimGrid)
#
#  It also defines a SIMGRID_VERSION macro, that you can use to deal with API
#    evolutions as follows:
#
#    #include <simgrid/version.h>
#    #if SIMGRID_VERSION < 31800
#      (code to use if the installed version is lower than v3.18)
#    #elif SIMGRID_VERSION < 31900
#      (code to use if we are using SimGrid v3.18.x)
#    #else
#      (code to use with SimGrid v3.19 or later)
#    #endif
#
#  Since SimGrid header files require C++17, we set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD to 17.
#    Change this variable in your own file if you need a later standard.

# DEVELOPPERS OF MPI PROGRAMS USING SIMGRID
#   You should use smpi_c_target() on the targets that are intended to run in SMPI.
#   ${SMPIRUN} is correctly set if it's installed.
#
#   Example:
#     add_executable(roundtrip roundtrip.c)
#     smpi_c_target(roundtrip)
#
#     enable_testing()
#     add_test(NAME Roundtrip
#              COMMAND ${SMPIRUN} -platform ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../cluster_backbone.xml -np 2 ./roundtrip)
