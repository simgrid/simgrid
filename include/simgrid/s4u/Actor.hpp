 * **Example of use:** `examples/cpp/exec-ptask/s4u-exec-ptask.cpp
 * <https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/examples/cpp/exec-ptask/s4u-exec-ptask.cpp>`_
 *
 * Parallel executions convenient abstractions of parallel computational kernels that span over several machines,
 * such as a PDGEM and the other ScaLAPACK routines. If you are interested in the effects of such parallel kernel
 * on the platform (e.g. to schedule them wisely), there is no need to model them in all details of their internal
 * execution and communications. It is much more convenient to model them as a single execution activity that spans
 * over several hosts. This is exactly what s4u's Parallel Executions are.
 *
 * To build such an object, you need to provide a list of hosts that are involved in the parallel kernel (the
 * actor's own host may or may not be in this list) and specify the amount of computations that should be done by
 * each host, using a vector of flops amount. Then, you should specify the amount of data exchanged between each
 * hosts during the parallel kernel. For that, a matrix of values is expected.
 *
 * It is OK to build a parallel execution without any computation and/or without any communication.
 * Just pass an empty vector to the corresponding parameter.
 *
 * For example, if your list of hosts is ``[host0, host1]``, passing a vector ``[1000, 2000]`` as a `flops_amount`
 * vector means that `host0` should compute 1000 flops while `host1` will compute 2000 flops. A matrix of
 * communications' sizes of ``[0, 1, 2, 3]`` specifies the following data exchanges:
 *
 * - from host0: [ to host0:  0 bytes; to host1: 1 byte ]
 *
 * - from host1: [ to host0: 2 bytes; to host1: 3 bytes ]
 *
 * Or, in other words:
 *
 * - From host0 to host0: 0 bytes are exchanged
 *
 * - From host0 to host1: 1 byte is exchanged
 *
 * - From host1 to host0: 2 bytes are exchanged
 *
 * - From host1 to host1: 3 bytes are exchanged
 *
 * In a parallel execution, all parts (all executions on each hosts, all communications) progress exactly at the
 * same pace, so they all terminate at the exact same pace. If one part is slow because of a slow resource or
 * because of contention, this slows down the parallel execution as a whole.
 *
 * These objects are somewhat surprising from a modeling point of view. For example, the unit of their speed is
 * somewhere between flop/sec and byte/sec. Arbitrary parallel executions will simply not work with the usual platform
 * models, and you must :ref:`use the ptask_L07 host model <models_l07>` for that. Note that you can mix
 * regular executions and communications with parallel executions, provided that the host model is ptask_L07.
