If you open a socket in SG realm, you'll get a SG socket.
If you open a socket in RL realm, you'll get a TCP socket.

To get a file socket, you'll have to build it manually using
gras_socket_client_from_file() to read from it, or
gras_socket_server_from_file() to write to it.

There is no way (yet?) to build a pipe socket, so threads have to
discuss using network sockets, or xbt_queue_t structures.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ABOUT THE SG SIDE

This area is quite messy. The thing is that I strived too much to keep
the existing interface, which is lousely inspirated from BSD sockets.

Vocabulary: 
  Server is the one who created the master socket. 
  Client is the one connecting to that from a remote host. 
  Their roles keep the same for the whole connexion duration. 
  Sender and Receiver denote the roles during one message exchange.
  If the server answers to the client, it becomes the sender while the
  client becomes the receiver. 
  All this seems trivial, but confusion is easy and dangerous.


The connexion story goes that way. When we create a master socket, we
look whether the given port is free on that host or not. For that, we
traverse the gras_hostdata_t->ports dynar, which contains
gras_sg_portrec_t records. If it's free, we create a socket with a
gras_trp_sg_sock_data_t structure. Here is that struct:

typedef struct { 
  smx_process_t server; 
  smx_process_t client;
    
  smx_rdv_t rdv_server; /* The rendez-vous point to use */
  smx_rdv_t rdv_client; /* The rendez-vous point to use */
  smx_comm_t comm_recv; /* The comm of irecv on receiver side */
} s_gras_trp_sg_sock_data_t,*gras_trp_sg_sock_data_t;

In GRAS, there is a listener process, in charge of pumping everything
comming from the network and post that to the main user thread. That
to overlap (incomming) communications and computations.
In SG, this is done by ensuring that a receive is posted on every
opened socket, and having the listener doing a smx_sem_waitany() to
find the first ending one (in RL, a select+ddt_recv does the same).

Another extra complexity is due to the fact that when the user
receives a message, it gets a socket being a mean to contact the
sender of that message. In RL, that's easy since sockets are
full-duplex. In SG, I have to either create a new socket for each
message (slow and leak-prone), or maintain a set of opened sockets on
receiver side and check if the one I need is there or create it. The
approach used currently is to give to the receiver a pointer to the
structure created on the sender side directly.

At the end of the day, everything is as if there were master socket
and working sockets, just like in BSD. There is no explicit accept.
Master sockets get created by gras_socket_server() and friends. You
can recognize them by the fact that the rdv_client field is always
NULL. Such sockets are not really used to exchange data, but more to
establish connexions. For actual exchanges, you need a working socket
created by gras_socket_client() and friends. So, they are created on
client side, but the master side will see it as message expeditor when
getting a message.

You can see which side of the socket you are with the
gras_socket_im_the_server() function, which is designed for that.
