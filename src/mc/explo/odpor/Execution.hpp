/**
 * @brief An ordered sequence of transitions which describe
 * the evolution of a process undergoing model checking
 *
 * An execution conceptually is just a string of actors
 * ids (e.g. "1.2.3.1.2.2.1.1"), where the `i`th occurrence
 * of actor id `j` corresponds to the `i`th action executed
 * by the actor with id `j` (viz. the `i`th step of actor `j`).
 * Executions can stand alone on their own or can extend
 * the execution of other sequences
 *
 * Executions are conceived based on the following papers:
 * 1. "Source Sets: A Foundation for Optimal Dynamic Partial Order Reduction"
 * by Abdulla et al.
 *
 * In addition to representing an actual steps taken,
 * an execution keeps track of the "happens-before"
 * relation among the transitions in the execution
 * by following the procedure outlined in section 4 of the
 * original DPOR paper with clock vectors.
 * As new transitions are added to the execution, clock vectors are
 * computed as appropriate and associated with the corresponding position
 * in the execution. This allows us to determine “happens-before” in
 * constant-time between points in the execution (called events
 * [which is unfortunately the same name used in UDPOR for a slightly
 * different concept]), albeit for an up-front cost of traversing the
 * execution stack. The happens-before relation is important in many
 * places in SDPOR and ODPOR.
 *
 * @note: For more nuanced happens-before relations, clock
 * vectors may not always suffice. Clock vectors work
 * well with transition-based dependencies like that used in
 * SimGrid; but to have a more refined independence relation,
 * an event-based dependency approach is needed. See the section 2
 * in the ODPOR paper [1] concerning event-based dependencies and
 * how the happens-before relation can be refined in a
 * computation model much like that of SimGrid. In fact, the same issue
 * arrises with UDPOR with context-sensitive dependencies:
 * the two concepts are analogous if not identical

   * @brief For a given sequence of actors `v` and a sequence of transitions `w`,
   * computes the sequence, if any, that should be inserted as a child in wakeup tree for
   * this execution
   *
   * Recall that the procedure for implementing the insertion
   * is outlined in section 6.2 of Abdulla et al. 2017 as follows:
   *
   * | Let `v` be the smallest (w.r.t to "<") sequence in [the tree] B
   * | such that `v ~_[E] w`. If `v` is a leaf node, the tree can be left
   * | unmodified.
   * |
   * | Otherwise let `w'` be the shortest sequence such that `w [=_[E] v.w'`
   * | and add `v.w'` as a new leaf, ordered after all already existing nodes
   * | of the form `v.w''`
   *
   * The procedure for determining whether `v ~_[E] w` is given as Lemma 4.6 of
   * Abdulla et al. 2017:
   *
   * | The relation `v ~_[E] w` holds if either
   * | (1) v = <>, or
   * | (2) v := p.v' and either
   * |     (a) p in I_[E](w) and `v' ~_[E.p] (w \ p)`
   * |     (b) E ⊢ p ◊ w and `v' ~_[E.p] w`
   *
   * This method computes the result `v.w'` as needed (viz. only if `v ~_[E] w`
   * with respect to this execution `E`). The implementation takes advantage
   * of the fact that determining whether `v ~_[E] w` yields "for free" the
   * the shortest such `w'` we are looking for; if we ultimately determine
   * that `v ~_[E] w`, the work we did to do so leaves us precisely with `w'`,
   * so we can simply prepend `v` to it and call it a day
   *
   * @precondition: This method assumes that `E.v` is a valid execution, viz.
   * that the events of `E` are sufficient to enabled `v_0` and that
   * `v_0, ..., v_{i - 1}` are sufficient to enable `v_i`. This is the
   * case when e.g. `v := notdep(e, E).p` for example in ODPOR
   *
   * @returns a partial execution `v.w'` that should be inserted
   * as a child of a wakeup tree node representing the sequence `v`
   * if `v ~_[E] w`, or `std::nullopt` if that relation does not hold
   * between the two sequences `v` and `w`
