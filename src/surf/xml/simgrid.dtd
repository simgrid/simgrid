             DTD of SimGrid platform and deployment files.

More info: https://simgrid.org/doc/latest/platform.html
To upgrade your files, use the tool simgrid_update_xml

* Things that will change in upcoming version 5 (TODO):
  - The following tags will be removed:
    - <include> spits an error since v3.18
    - <random> and <model_prop> do nothing since a very long time
    - <as>, <asroute>, <bypassASRoute> and <process>, deprecated in DTD4.1
  - FULLDUPLEX sharing will be removed, deprecated in DTD4.2 (v3.19)

* New in DTD version 4.1 (in SimGrid 3.16): backward compatible change (v4 files are valid v4.1 files)
   - <zone> can be used as a synonym for the now deprecated <as>
   - <zoneRoute> can be used as a synonym for the now deprecated <asroute>
   - <bypassZoneRoute> can be used as a synonym for the now deprecated <bypassAsRoute>
   - <actor> can be used as a synonym for the now deprecated <process>
  Other backward-compatible changes for which we did not bump the DTD version.
  - SPLITDUPLEX is the new spelling of the deprecated FULLDUPLEX (SimGrid v3.19)
  - In <host> and <peer> availability_file is now speed_file (SimGrid v3.22)

* New in DTD version 4 (in SimGrid 3.13):
   - Rename (power->speed) the attributes describing the amount of flop
     that a <host>, <peer>, <cluster> or <cabinet> can deliver per second.

   - In <trace_connect>, attribute kind="POWER" is now kind="SPEED".

   - In <host> and <link>, attributes availability and state are gone.
     It was redundant with state and availability profiles, and with peak values.

   - In <cluster>, cannot set the availability nor state profiles.
     This was too complex and unused.

   - The DOCTYPE points to the right URL (this file).

   - Kill <gpu>. Was not doing anything.

   - A warning is emitted for unit-less values (they are still accepted).
     The value 0 can remain unit-less, as its unit does not matter.

     - speed. Default: 'f' or 'flops'. Also defined:
        'Yf',         'Zf',         'Ef',       'Pf',        'Tf',        'Gf',        'Mf',        'kf'
        'yottaflops', 'zettaflops', 'exaflops', 'petaflops', 'teraflops', 'gigaflops', 'megaflops', 'kiloflops'

     - bandwidth. Default: 'Bps' bytes per second
       In bytes and powers of 2  (1 KiBps = 1024 Bps): 'EiBps', 'PiBps', 'TiBps', 'GiBps', 'MiBps', 'KiBps'
       In bits  and powers of 2  (1 Bps = 8 bps)     : 'Eibps', 'Pibps', 'Tibps', 'Gibps', 'Mibps', 'Kibps'
       In bytes and powers of 10 (1 KBps = 1000 Bps) : 'EBps', 'PBps', 'TBps', 'GBps', 'MBps', 'kBps', 'Bps'
       In bits  and powers of 10                     : 'Ebps', 'Pbps', 'Tbps', 'Gbps', 'Mbps', 'kbps', 'bps'
       (Exa and Peta notations were introduced in SimGrid v3.14)

     - latency. Default: 's' second. Also defined:
       'w' week, 'd' day, 'h' hour, 'm' minute, 'ms' millisecond, 'us' microsecond, 'ns' nanosecond, 'ps' picosecond

* New in DTD version 3 (in SimGrid 3.5):
   - The AS tag were introduced. Every platform should now
     contain an englobing AS tag.
   - Routes are now symmetric by default.
   - Renamed tags (for sake of XML sanity):
     - LINK:CTN -> LINK_CTN
     - TRACE:CONNECT -> TRACE_CONNECT

* New in DTD version 2 (in SimGrid 3.4):
   - Renamed tags:
     - CPU -> HOST
     - NETWORK_LINK -> LINK
     - ROUTE_ELEMENT ->  LINK:CTN (changed again in v3)
     - PLATFORM_DESCRIPTION -> PLATFORM

* New in DTD version 1 (in SimGrid 3.3):
   - DTD is now versioned with the version attribute of platform
   - Unit change:
     - Link bandwidth: from Mb/s to b/s
     - CPU speed: from MFlop/s to Flop/s
